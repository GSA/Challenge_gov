Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers’ ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack).</p>\n\n<p>The Rodeo II Challenge series will create algorithms to enhance sub-seasonal forecasting, reducing risks to our water systems, and helping water managers efficiently manage hydrological variations.</p>\n\n<p>This challenge series will first have one traditional marathon match challenge to establish predictive algorithms on historical weather data, and then recurring data science challenges (sprints) over the next <strong>full year</strong> to refine those solutions on live weather data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Pre-Registration:</strong> June 27 to week of July 19, 2019</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marathon Match:</strong> Week of July 19th to week of August 18th, 2019</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Science Sprints:</strong> Fall 2019 start to Fall 2020 with recurring sprints every two weeks over the full year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marathon Match Winners:</strong> Anticipate announcement late to early September 2019</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Science Sprint Winners:</strong> Anticipate announcement of winners after each sprint, beginning in late Fall 2019</p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Science Full Year Winners:</strong> Anticipate announcement of winners at the end of the full year in late 2020 to possibly early 2021.</p>\n",

            "description": "<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n\n<p>At an unprecedented pace, Federal and state leaders, community based organizations, and all avenues of the health care system are expending their time and resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We at ACL recognize the need and are expanding the timeline of this new funding opportunity. The Challenge Competition will now begin in July. As a result of this crises, there is a greater need for enhanced, standardized data tracking and referral processes and an even more need to connect people with the right community resources and supports. This will continue to be a priority as we think about the resources necessary to address the effects of COVID-19.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"todays-landscape-of-health-and-social-care-coordination-for-older-adults-and-people-with-disabilities\"><strong>Today’s Landscape of Health and Social Care Coordination for Older Adults and People with Disabilities:</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Individual health plans and health systems are implementing technology approaches to screen and refer individuals to community resources in order to address their social needs and improve their health and overall well-being. However, the existing technology solutions lack interoperability and scalability within and across communities. Since 2003, states and community based organizations (CBOs) have invested in robust resource directory and referral platforms through state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/\">No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a> integration to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. Community Based Organizations may include Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resources Centers, Centers for Independent Living or other aging and disability network agencies. State NWD Systems include a community based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state. However, provider and plan specific referral platforms are often not leveraging this existing infrastructure that enables access to a variety of services and supports that address social needs.</p>\n\n<p>While some states have developed or are planning statewide technology platforms that enable social  risk assessments and referrals from health care to community resources, there is a need for a more collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach that ensures the interoperability and scalability of such platforms. Examples of statewide approaches include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Oregon Health Leadership Council, HIT Commons: <a href=\"http://www.orhealthleadershipcouncil.org/hit-commons/\">http://www.orhealthleadershipcouncil.org/hit-commons/</a>,</li>\n  <li>Pennsylvania Request for Information for Statewide Resource and Referral Tool: <a href=\"http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=Resource%20and%20Referral%20Tool\">http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=Resource%20and%20Referral%20Tool</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As is, there is duplicative spending across stakeholders as they independently contract for different referral vendors to secure community connections. As a result, community based organizations are faced with the burden of accessing multiple platforms to receive and act on referrals. Opportunities to manage populations across a continuum of care are also limited when individuals seek care from providers with differing platforms that lack seamless connections to critical health and social care.</p>\n\n<p>The need for seamless exchange of referrals is also met with optimizing data on social determinants of health (SDoH) to ensure individuals get timely access to services and supports they need such as housing, nutrition, and transportation. Over the last several years, a variety of community led efforts are developing <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/advancing-interoperable-social-determinants-of-health-data\">industry-wide standards</a> to represent these components of SDoH and to enable exchange of person-centered data between health information technology platforms and CBOs. One such effort, perhaps the largest such activity in the SDoH space, is the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/gravity/\">Gravity Project</a>. The Gravity Project aims to standardize medical codes and exchange standards to facilitate the use of SDoH-related data across a wide range of care management settings between health care and human services providers, and others as authorized and appropriate. There is a need for health plans and systems to require and for technology vendors to uniformly adopt technical standards, which are being developed and tested. This include standards on the format, content and structure of SDoH data, community resource directories, and bi-directional exchange of referral messages.  The mid-to-long term goal is consistent implementation of standards for SDoH data, bi-directional exchange of referrals, and resource directories across technology platforms that serve health care and CBOs.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge:</h4>\n\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for state and community leaders in the aging and disability network, health care systems, health plans, and health IT vendors to cultivate care coordination by developing and/or optimizing interoperable and scalable technology platforms. Participants are challenged with working collaboratively on enhancing scalable approaches to securely sharing standardized data on social determinants and person-centered plans through the use of open resource directories that seamlessly connect and interoperate with health care system’s electronic health records to community based organizations. This Challenge includes developing prototypes and implementing technical solutions that track referral patterns and gaps in service that visibly display social service and health related outcomes overtime.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate value and achieve seamless network integration technical solutions are challenged with incorporating closed-loop referral and follow-up protocols to track and support individuals when they obtain services from any organization or health care provider within the network. Producing data on the individual, organizational, and regional levels about referrals, the prevalence of SDoH, and service utilization and outcomes guarantees opportunities to strengthen coordinated referral networks across CBOs, states, and the health care system. Technology-based platforms that enable linkages between healthcare providers and the existing ecosystem of community-based, social service organizations are challenged to more efficiently share standardized data to support referral processes and better informed decision-making, ensuring that individuals are seamlessly connected to resources that address their preferences, goals, values, and social determinants in ways that promote independence in the community for as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this Challenge should include a team of key stakeholders. Strong preference will be given to teams that include state leaders across aging, disability and Medicaid programs (or their designees), community based organizations in the aging and disability networks, health IT developers, health care providers, health plans, and others with expertise in technical standards, interoperability and data analysis.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will compete in three phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $500,000.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 1: Concept &amp; Design Submission (July - December 2020)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Form multi-stakeholder team, submit letter of intent and develop idea and concept designs that include data visualization methods and functional enhancements to technology platforms that connect health and social services.</li>\n  <li><strong>Registration and Phase 1 Application due Monday, December 14, 2020. See below for more information.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Phase 2: Proof of Concept &amp; Demonstration (January 2021 - June 2021)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Participant teams will convene in-person or virtually to demo proposed solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Phase 3: Implementation &amp; Testing - (July - December 2021)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Implementation and real-world testing of designed approach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"what-is-a-challenge\">What is a Challenge?</h4>\n\n<p>A challenge (also referred to as “prize challenge”, “competition,” “prize competition,” “incentive prize” or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li>\n  <li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li>\n  <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of. The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li>\n  <li>Reach wide communities of experts</li>\n  <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li>\n  <li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li>\n  <li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit: https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The mission of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (“CFTC”) is to promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation. As part of this mission, the CFTC regulates a variety of individuals and organizations. These include futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, retail foreign exchange dealers, introducing brokers, designated contract markets, foreign boards of trade, swap dealers, and other entities and individuals. To promote market integrity, the CFTC surveils the derivatives markets for various abuses, and holds wrongdoers accountable.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, fraudsters use a variety of social engineering, fake profiling, and manipulative techniques to ensnare their victims. Fraud tactics regularly employ common keywords and phrases. With this information, there is an opportunity to utilize modern technology as a tool to augment traditional, manual efforts and to identify bad actors.</p>\n\n<p>The CFTC is vigilant to protect customers from unscrupulous fraudsters, including those operating outside the U.S. LabCFTC is launching this competition (“Project Streetlamp”) to call on innovators to utilize technology, including artificial intelligence (“AI”), and innovative approaches to detect foreign entities that should be – but are not –registered with the CFTC. The competition is intended to generate information that ultimately helps customers make more informed decisions about whether to trade with, or through, these unregistered foreign entities.</p>\n\n<p>View the Project Streetlamp <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/project-streetlamp-official-announcement.pdf\">official announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The RED List</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Registration Deficient List, or “<a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/Resources/Check/redlist.htm\">RED List</a>,” provides public notice that a foreign entity is engaged in conduct that requires registration with the CFTC, but has not in fact registered. Generally, foreign entities that solicit U.S. residents to trade in CFTC-regulated markets are required to register with the CFTC. Registration provides both a legal framework that includes safeguards and client protections, as well as mechanisms for recourse in the event an issue arises.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the RED List is to provide information to U.S. customers about foreign entities that are acting in an unregistered capacity and to help them make more informed decisions about whether to trade with or through such an entity. While registration is no guarantee against fraud or mismanagement by an otherwise unscrupulous firm or individual, registration does bring a higher level of security and accountability to the trading public. Customers that trade with and through registered entities have greater protections and recourse available.</p>\n\n<p>In certain cases, a review by the CFTC reveals that certain foreign entities solicit and/or accept funds from U.S. customers, have limited or no U.S. presence, and may be acting in a capacity that requires registration, but yet are <em>not</em> registered with the CFTC. After such review, foreign entities which meet the RED List criteria are included on the RED List.</p>\n\n<p>The process to update and maintain the RED List relies on tips and referrals from concerned individuals as well as investigative work by CFTC staff. The work is time-intensive. Given the scope of global markets, range of participants, and limited resources, the process could benefit from technology applications, including those that leverage AI, which can identify and flag potentially problematic activity for further follow-up by CFTC staff. This may enable a more efficient and comprehensive search and review process to identify foreign entities for inclusion on the RED List. Also, it could enable the CFTC to be proactive in its ongoing efforts to maintain the RED List. Currently, it is only after wrongdoing is <em>reported</em> that an entity is investigated for possible enforcement action or inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"competition\">Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The goal of Project Streetlamp is to explore how AI and other technologies can help the CFTC maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date RED List by automating the process of identifying foreign entities potentially engaged in CFTC-regulated activity.  AI could be an important component of such a tool, because the technology has the potential to learn the “footprints” of actors that are unregistered, but engaged in CFTC-regulated activity. For example, key identifying data (<em>e.g.</em>, keywords, website data, audience information, network and outreach, etc.) associated with unregistered entities known to be engaged in CFTC-regulated activity could be used to develop a model that is useful for identifying other unknown entities.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will develop a tool to identify companies engaged in activity that the CFTC should investigate further for possible inclusion on the RED List. Such activity may include, but is not limited to: soliciting or accepting customers’ orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool. This information may also help identify broader trends or behavior that the CFTC finds helpful to target customer education and awareness efforts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"red-list-inclusion-criteria\">RED List Inclusion Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>The following criteria may help competition participants develop a tool that can appropriately identify foreign entities that should be included on the CFTC’s RED List.</p>\n\n<p><em>1.  Is the entity foreign?</em></p>\n\n<p>Only foreign entities are included on the RED List. For purposes of the tool, an entity is foreign if its place of business is anywhere other than the U.S. An entity may not be domestic simply because it self-identifies as having a physical presence in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p><em>2.  Does the foreign entity have any or a limited U.S. presence?</em></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of the tool, an entity that has only a limited U.S. presence may still be considered a “foreign entity” and included on the RED List. An entity will be considered to have a limited U.S. presence if its only presence is: a virtual office; a sham address; a U.S. phone number; or its website or domain hosting service. An entity that has more than a limited U.S. presence is not considered a “foreign entity,” and therefore the tool should not designate it for the RED List. For this purpose, indicia of a U.S. presence may include, among other things, whether an entity has: a U.S. agent or representative; a bank or other financial account(s) held by a financial institution in the U.S; a physical office space; or any other substantive presence in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p><em>3.  Does the foreign entity appear to solicit or accept U.S.-based residents?</em></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of the tool, an entity solicits a U.S. resident if, from a U.S.-based IP address: a U.S. resident is able to open an account with the entity; or the entity does not block a U.S. resident from opening an account.</p>\n\n<p><em>4.  Does the foreign entity offer products within the CFTC’s jurisdiction, including for example, futures, options on futures (“options”), foreign currency (“forex”), binary options, leveraged metals, contracts for difference (“CFD”), or Bitcoin derivatives (and any other virtual currency contracts regulated by the CFTC)?</em></p>\n\n<p>Where an unregistered foreign entity offers futures, options, forex, CFDs, or other derivatives subject to CFTC jurisdiction to U.S. customers the tool should consider this a positive factor for inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<p><em>5.  Is the foreign entity required to be registered with the CFTC?</em></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of the tool, conduct in connection with a CFTC jurisdictional product that requires registration with the CFTC may include, among other things: accepting customer funds; soliciting or accepting customers’ orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool.</p>\n\n<p><em>6.  Is the foreign entity currently not registered with the CFTC?</em></p>\n\n<p>The National Futures Association’s public registration database at <a href=\"https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet\">https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet</a> includes entities that are registered with the CFTC. If an entity is registered or has an exemption from registration, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<p><em>7.  In the case of binary options, is the foreign entity currently not registered as a Foreign Board of Trade (“FBOT”)?</em></p>\n\n<p>The CFTC maintains a <a href=\"https://sirt.cftc.gov/sirt/sirt.aspx?Topic=ForeignBoardsofTrade\">database of registered FBOT’s</a>. If an entity is registered as an FBOT, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"outputs\">Outputs</h4>\n\n<p>For purposes of this contest, successful tools will use AI and/or other technology to scan public sources and relevant data. To accomplish this, a tool should be able to assess foreign entities against the criteria listed above in order to generate a report that identifies foreign entities for potential inclusion on the RED List. To the extent possible, the output should include the foreign entity’s name and/or “doing business as” name, country of origin, owners/operators, and contact information (phone, email, social media, website(s), and/or address(es)), as may be available. The tool should also be able to provide a justification based on the criteria above for why any particular foreign entity has been identified.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the tool should incorporate an archive function that saves searches and results for future reference and audit purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will determine the best approach to create their tool and to deploy it, as well as the format of the report and output that is generated. The output may be in any machine readable format (<em>e.g.</em>, csv, xml, excel) to facilitate further analysis.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Reference to the NFA is for informational purposes only and does not constitute endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the U.S. government.</em></p>\n",

For more information about these changes please contact <a href=\"mailto:inclusivedesign@dot.gov\">inclusivedesign@dot.gov</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n\n<p>An estimated <a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/travel-patterns-with-disabilities\">25.5 million Americans experience a travel-limiting disability</a> that impacts their access to employment, medical care, and other activities of daily living. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical need for vulnerable populations to have on-demand transportation services to access healthcare, pharmacies, grocery stores, and other essential services. Automated vehicles, particularly those designed to be operated exclusively by Level 4 and Level 5 Automated Driving Systems (ADS), hold great promise to enhance freedom of movement for these individuals. However, fulfilling this promise will require innovation and creativity, not only in how vehicles drive themselves, but also in how all users access and interact with them.</p>\n\n<p>Through the Inclusive Design Challenge, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks innovative, inclusive design features to enable people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities to use automated vehicles, particularly ADS-dedicated vehicles (ADS-DV) that are operated exclusively at Levels 4 and 5 (see Notes on Terminology below for additional detail on terms used throughout this Challenge). Solutions must address one or more aspects of ADS-DV use - such as locating and entering an ADS-DV or interacting with the vehicle in routine and emergency situations - through physical hardware and/or human-machine interface (HMI) designs. Individuals and teams will compete for an overall prize purse of up to $5,000,000 in a two-stage competition. In Stage I, DOT solicits brief technical proposals for inclusive design features that could then be demonstrated in prototype form by semifinalists in Stage II.</p>\n\n<p>By using a prize competition format, DOT seeks to draw attention to the topic of passenger vehicle accessibility; encourage new cross-disciplinary collaborations; incentivize the development of new approaches and technologies to improve mobility; and tap into the creativity and knowledge of the disability community, researchers, advocates, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs. DOT aims to attract ideas from around the nation to identify new solutions for common access issues.</p>\n\n<p>This Challenge seeks inclusive solutions, referring to features and designs that enable access to and use of a vehicle by people with a wide range of physical, sensory and cognitive disabilities. Technology has already changed how most of us get around. This Challenge seeks to ensure that these new technology-driven mobility options are inclusive of all Americans.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n\n<p>DOT is eager to realize the potential mobility benefits that ADS-DVs could bring to people with disabilities. ADS-DVs, could offer greater levels of mobility for individuals who either cannot drive or require a vehicle with extensive modifications, but only if their needs are considered explicitly and incorporated into future ADS-DV designs. DOT recognizes that the diversity of disabilities and resulting implications for vehicle design features makes this a complicated engineering challenge. While some mobility services (e.g., public transportation or for-hire vehicles, such as taxis) currently incorporate some accessibility features, few of these features are universally included in passenger vehicles as part of vehicle design. Meanwhile, aftermarket solutions tend to be expensive and cumbersome.</p>\n\n<p>Several recent publications are provided at <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign\">www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign</a> to offer further information on the needs, challenges, and opportunities that ADS-DVs introduce for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-details\">Challenge Details</h4>\n\n<p>DOT seeks ideas for inclusive features that will enable future ADS-DVs to meet the needs of people with disabilities safely, effectively, and efficiently. Participants will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative design solutions to increase access to and use of ADS-DVs for people with disabilities. Such features can be human-machine interfaces, physical hardware designs, or combinations thereof that can allow a person with a physical, sensory, and/or cognitive disability to perform one or more tasks required to use an ADS-DV. Solutions may be proposed as standalone features or integrated into a holistic vehicle design. Successful solutions will show that they have taken into account production feasibility and an understanding of the needs and constraints of both industry and travelers with disabilities. The Department notes that it is seeking to further innovation in inclusive design for ADS-DVs with this Challenge, rather than the development of the Automated Driving Systems themselves. Thus, awards are judged solely on the factors described in this statement, and are not based on the sophistication Of any ADS included as part of a prototype vehicle. See Stage II Prototype/Demonstration below for additional details on prototype expectations and requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The sections below provide important information on elements to consider as part of your Challenge solution.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"vehicle-platform\"><em>Vehicle Platform</em></h5>\n\n<p>Participants should consider features intended to be incorporated into vehicles that can serve a wide range of communities and are capable of operating at highway speeds. Participants have flexibility in choosing a vehicle to use as a reference or base platform in developing their feature(s), keeping in mind the focus of the Challenge is developing inclusive solutions for ADS-DVs that could either function as personal vehicles or as part of a shared private fleet. Please note that the Challenge is not specifically soliciting solutions to be used exclusively in public transportation. However, successful solutions may have application to both private and public transportation.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"vehicle-use\"><em>Vehicle Use</em></h5>\n\n<p>Participants will develop inclusive design solutions to address one or more of the following tasks that an ADS-DV user with a disability will need to complete:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Locating an ADS-DV - Including, but not limited to, being notified that a vehicle has arrived; identifying the correct vehicle and locating and navigating to the correct vehicle.</li>\n  <li>Entering an ADS-DV- Including, but not limited to, unlocking and opening vehicle door(s); deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for wheelchair users or people with other physical disabilities or mobility equipment; and closing vehicle door(s).</li>\n  <li>Securing Passengers and Mobility Equipment - Including, but not limited to, securing seatbelts and other passenger restraints; securing wheelchairs or other mobility equipment to the vehicle; and accommodating service animals.</li>\n  <li>Inputting Information - Including, but not limited to, confirming passenger identity; searching for, entering, and changing a desired destination; confirming the vehicle’s destination; selecting a specific drop-off point (e.g., a particular entrance to a large complex or a location with a curb cut or sufficient space to deploy a ramp or other physical device).</li>\n  <li>Interacting with the ADS in routine and emergency situations - Including, but not limited to, operating passenger convenience and safety features (e.g., entertainment, window controls, locks, climate control); monitoring the vehicle’s location and route progress; changing the vehicle’s destination en route; requesting assistance (emergency or non-emergency); understanding and performing appropriate actions in the event of a breakdown or crash.</li>\n  <li>Exiting an ADS-DV - Including, but not limited to, being notified and confirming that a vehicle has reached its intended destination; releasing passenger and/or mobility equipment restraints; identifying and locating the safe and appropriate door(s) from which to exit the vehicle; recognizing when it is safe to exit a vehicle; opening door(s) and deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for passengers and/or mobility equipment (e.g., wheelchairs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"disability-types\"><em>Disability Types</em></h5>\n\n<p>For the Challenge, inclusiveness will be evaluated, in part, by the extent to which proposed solutions address a range of disabilities and needs. As noted above, applicants will need to demonstrate working engagement(s) with representatives from the disability community in their design process.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will also focus their efforts by designing solutions for use by one or more of the following groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>People with physical disabilities</li>\n  <li>People with sensory disabilities</li>\n  <li>People with cognitive disabilities</li>\n  <li>People with multiple types of disabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"production-feasibility\"><em>Production Feasibility</em></h5>\n\n<p>DOT seeks proposals through this Challenge that strike a balance between innovation and near-term implementation. For innovation to have the desired impact, implementation is critical. Participants are expected to discuss factors related to the feasibility of producing their solution(s), including the maturity of the technology underlying the inclusive design elements of the proposed design, as well as cost and other production considerations. “Production” here refers to the incorporation of the proposed solution(s) into a vehicle as original equipment, integration into an existing vehicle platform as part of an aftermarket modification, or a holistic reimagining of passenger vehicle design with a focus on seamlessly integrating inclusive features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-structure\">Challenge Structure</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"overall-schedule\"><em>Overall Schedule</em></h5>\n\n<p>DOT anticipates that the Challenge will proceed according to the schedule outlined below. Dates are subject to change with any changes being posted on the DOT’s Challenge website accordingly.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stage I Launch: April 21, 2020</li>\n  <li>Stage I Close: October 30, 2020, 5:00 PM Eastern</li>\n  <li>Stage I Selection/ Awards, Launch of Stage II: January 2021 (anticipated)</li>\n  <li>Stage II Design Charrette: Summer 2021 (anticipated)</li>\n  <li>Stage II Close, Prototype Demonstrations at U.S. DOT Headquarters: June 2022 (anticipated)</li>\n  <li>Stage II Prize Selections: July 2022 (anticipated)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"stage-i-proof-of-concept\"><em>Stage I, Proof of Concept</em></h5>\n\n<p>In Stage I, eligible Participants will submit proposals for inclusive design solutions for ADS-DVs. DOT will select up to ten semifinalists to advance to Stage II to develop a functional prototype of their idea and compete for a cash prize.</p>\n\n<p>Stage I proposals will be limited to written, descriptive summaries (no more than 10 pages; see “Stage I Submission Requirements” below for additional detail on proposal length constraints), supporting visual exhibits, and accompanying information (team biographies, etc.) as outlined below.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"stage-ii-prototypedemonstration\"><em>Stage II, Prototype/Demonstration</em></h5>\n\n<p>In Stage II, the semifinalists selected to advance from Stage I will develop their concepts into functional prototypes of an inclusive design solution.</p>\n\n<p>A functional prototype may include one or more of the options outlined below, as appropriate given the nature of solution(s) being demonstrated, their sophistication, and the time available. DOT will not require semifinalists to demonstrate their proposed feature(s) on an actual vehicle, although a team may determine that doing so is necessary and/or advantageous to illustrate maturity, production/integration feasibility, or functionality.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Full-size physical prototype</strong>, either:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Integrated into a vehicle (the vehicle itself does not need to be automated, but should be reflective of vehicles being developed and tested with Level 4 or 5 automation).</li>\n      <li>Full-size, standalone demonstration separate from a vehicle. In this case, Participants should be prepared to illustrate how their proposed solution would be integrated into a full-size vehicle, potentially through one of the other prototype approaches listed.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Software prototype</strong> - Given that certain solutions or components of broader solutions will entail a software/interface component, Participants can consider functioning software interfaces as prototypes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Scale physical prototype</strong> - If a full-size physical prototype is infeasible for the proposed solution given the time and resources available, Participants may consider demonstrating their concept via a scale model. Accompanying demonstration exhibits may complement scale prototypes, particularly to demonstrate engineering feasibility, integration into a vehicle platform, and usability.</li>\n  <li><strong>Virtual prototype</strong> - DOT will consider the submission of virtual prototypes (3D models, computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, schematics) of physical solutions, but strongly encourages Participants to consider other primary means of demonstrating their solution(s), and to limit the use of virtual prototypes to supporting/secondary exhibits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DOT anticipates that partway through Stage II one or more design charrettes will be held with subject matter experts from industry and the disability community. At the end of Stage II, teams will be invited to Washington, D.C. to demonstrate their prototypes. After this, the final prize selections will be announced. Up to three finalists will be selected and awarded a portion of the remaining prize purse, contingent upon review of the Stage II submissions and demonstrations against the judging criteria. As discussed below under Judging Criteria, the details of Stage II are subject to change and will not be finalized until Stage I is complete. DOT may, in its sole discretion, not proceed with Stage II.</p>\n",
            "prizes": "<p>The Challenge consists of two stages. Individuals and teams will compete for an overall prize purse of up to $5,000,000.

Neither the U.S. Department of Transportation nor anyone acting on its behalf will obtain any rights in intellectual property developed prior to or during the conduct of this Challenge without the prior written consent of the Participant. By participating in the Challenge, the Participant is not granting rights in any patents, pending patent applications, or copyrights related to the technology described in their submission. However, by submitting their entry, the Participant is granting the U.S; Department of Transportation and any parties acting on its behalf certain limited rights as set forth herein.</p>\n\n<p>By virtue of their submission to this Challenge, Participants grant to the DOT, and any parties acting on their behalf the right to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>review the submission per the Stage I Judging Criteria;</li>\n  <li>describe the submission in any materials created in connection with this Challenge; and</li>\n  <li>screen and evaluate the submission per the Stage II Judging Criteria, if Participant is selected for Stage II.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Participant further grants the DOT, and anyone acting on its behalf the right to publicize Participant’s name and, as applicable, the name of Participant’s team members and/or the name of any Entity that assisted in preparing Participant’s submission. Such authority includes posting or linking to the Participant’s submission on U.S. Department of Transportation websites, including the Challenge website, Participant’s websites, and inclusion of the Participant’s submission in any other media, worldwide. More specifically, such authority includes the right to copy, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform all parts of Participant’s submission.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"notes-on-terminology\">Notes on Terminology</h4>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>This Challenge focuses specifically on vehicles operated exclusively by a Level 4 and 5 ADS, a level of automation at which human occupants are not expected to serve as a fallback, as long as the vehicle remains within the system’s operational design domain. In its standard J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems, SAE International refers to such vehicles as ADS-dedicated vehicles or ADS-DVs. DOT recognizes that some solutions proposed through this Challenge may also be applicable to dual-mode vehicles - capable of both driverless operation and operation by a conventional driver for a complete trip.</li>\n  <li>In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-14]), Congress reallocated $100 million for “. . . a highly automated vehicle (HAV) research and development program,” a portion of which is being used to fund this Challenge. The accompanying Explanatory Statement further clarified: “Of the total amount provided, not less than $38,000,000 shall be used for direct research, including administrative expenses, on HAV and [Advanced Driver Assistance System] technologies by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration, of which no more than $5,000,000 shall be for ADAS research. For the purposes of the agreement, HAV refers to technologies capable of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) DOT Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automation, whereas ADAS refers to technologies capable of Level 1 or Level 2” (Division L, Title 1). DOT previously used the term HAV to refer to vehicles with Level 3-5 driving automation, but subsequently adopted the terminology in SAE J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.</li>\n</ol>\n",
            "judging": "\n<h4 id=\"stage-i-judging-criteria\">Stage I Judging Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>The judging panel will consider each submission’s alignment with each of these criteria and make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation.

            "description": "<p>Though the proportions of women and men are similar at the graduate level for biomedical sciences and in medical schools, women are underrepresented at the faculty level in both science and medicine, particularly in the mid- to senior-level ranks (<a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/\">National Science Foundation 2017 Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities</a>; and <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27587850/\">2016 CBE Life Sci Educ. 15(3)</a>). Diversity of thought and expertise have been recognized as attributes that drive innovation, complement dynamic research, and promote excellence. Supporting the sustained advancement of women in biomedical careers has the potential to enhance such diversity in the faculty ranks across scientific fields. Doing so will also promote more inclusive research and clinical environments which are critical to retaining and advancing women in biomedical careers.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to enhancing diversity in academia and that ideas based on evidence are necessary to achieve systemic change, this prize competition will recognize institutions for approaches that have clearly succeeded in addressing faculty diversity and equity issues in biomedical and behavioral science departments, centers, or divisions. The aim is to acknowledge and recognize transformative structures, systems, projects, programs, and processes that were implemented to successfully enhance and sustain gender diversity within the institution. For example, success could have been accomplished through addressing barriers to career advancement, employing mentoring structures, adopting work-life integration and career flexibility programs, enhancing pathways to leadership, implementing specific recruitment efforts, changing workplace culture, or other approaches. This prize competition may build on the outcomes of previous initiatives, such as NIH’s Research on Causal Factors and Interventions that Promote and Support the Careers of Women in Biomedical and Behavioral Science and Engineering (<a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-gm-09-012.html\">RFA-FM-09-012</a>), the National Science Foundation <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5383\">ADVANCE</a> program, or other programs and/or internal initiatives in support of interventions that improve the climate and career advancement for women faculty at academic institutions.</p>\n\n<p>Critical to this prize competition is the identification of best practices, the sharing of lessons learned, and the delineation of evidence-based approaches that can be broadly translated to, and replicated by, other institutions. These approaches may represent policies, evidence-based programs, tools, and/or activities, or a mixture thereof. Because this prize competition recognizes achievement through past intervention(s), such interventions must have been implemented prior to the launch date of this prize competition. The interventions must also have a demonstrated record as an effective model that can be adapted by other institutions and organizations. The past efforts and interventions should have addressed the full range of faculty career stages, from junior faculty to senior leadership, as well as potential sources of gender-based inequities, such as pay or allocation of resources. Applicants will need to demonstrate how their interventions have directly led to sustained systemic changes within the institution. Therefore, an in-depth assessment of institutional composition, policies, other relevant factors that were potential barriers to gender diversity and equity, and were subsequently mitigated through intervention(s), will need to be included in the submission. Submissions most likely to win the prize competition will have developed tools and/or interventions that can be employed to assist other institutions or academic groups with issues of inclusion and help to create environments that facilitate achievement. These efforts should be amenable to wide dissemination and implementation, as best practices for enhancing faculty gender diversity in biomedical and behavioral sciences.</p>\n",

These updates will be reviewed at the MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge webinar on August 12, 2020.  A link to register for the webinar is included below.</h4>\n\n<p>This year, we’ve been forced to rethink the myriad of different ways we connect, socialize and interact with each other. In the absence of face-to-face time, can technology and online tools help us make, maintain, and strengthen those connections so vital to everyday life? We believe they can. That’s why we need your help.</p>\n\n<p>Can you design an easy-to-use online directory of social engagement programs and technology tools and products that matches end-users who are socially isolated with customized suggestions, tailored to meet their specific needs, interests, and abilities, in one seamless end-to-end experience? Then we want to hear from you.</p>\n\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL) along with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, are offering up to $750,000 in prizes and an opportunity to reach up to 10 million Americans. The prize will be awarded to the winner at the CES in January 2021. ACL and OASH are joined by the Consumer Technology Association Foundation (CTA Foundation), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in promoting the competition and judging and/or evaluating the submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Are you up to the challenge? Learn more about the competition and how to apply below.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"backgroundissue\">Background/Issue</h4>\n\n<p>The number of people in the United States aged 65 or older will almost double from 49 million in 2020 to 95 million by the year 2060 comprising nearly one quarter of the total US population. Among the senior population, nearly 25% of Americans aged 65-and-over are considered to be socially isolated - “the objective state of having few social relationships or infrequent social contact with others” - while 43% of those 60-and-over report feeling lonely.</p>\n\n<p>A constellation of harmful health outcomes have been associated with isolation and loneliness including premature mortality, a higher risk for developing dementia, heart failure and stroke, and increased risk of hospitalizations. In light of these health risk factors, it is unsurprising that analyses of Medicare spending has revealed an additional $6.7 billion spent annually on enrollees who are socially isolated.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance in fostering the development of innovative solutions to combat the harmful effects of these risk factors and the role technology has in addressing social isolation and loneliness, in March 2019, the White House National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released a report on “Emerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population.”</p>\n\n<p>The challenges brought forth by social isolation and loneliness has come to the fore during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  As the nation continues to adhere to public health recommendations of social distancing, an increasingly recognized secondary outcome is the risk social distancing can have on rates of loneliness and social isolation especially among our nation’s most vulnerable populations including older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes and our nation’s Veterans population.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>While there are an array of technologies and social engagement programs in the marketplace, there are considerable gaps in both awareness of and access to these technologies and programming for those individuals most likely to be lonely and isolated. Consequently, there is an opportunity to increase access and awareness to technologies and social engagement programming.</p>\n\n<p>ACL and OASH are pleased to announce the <strong>M</strong>obilizing and <strong>E</strong>mpowering the <strong>N</strong>ation and <strong>T</strong>echnology to <strong>A</strong>ddress <strong>L</strong>oneliness &amp; social isolation (MENTAL)  Health Innovation Challenge to address this need. Supporting partners include the VA, FCC, and the CTA Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>With this health innovation challenge we hope to recognize innovative ideas and solutions that seek to develop a software platform that increases awareness of, access to and use of social engagement technologies and programming to help curtail the impact of loneliness and social isolation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge asks care partners, local communities, businesses, non-profit organizations, institutions, healthcare providers, technologists, academics, among others in the global community for innovative solutions to combat loneliness and social isolation in vulnerable populations including Veterans, older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes that may be isolated from visitors and family members during a quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to increase consumer awareness and use of technology tools that keep older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations, and Veterans socially engaged and connected to families, friends, communities and activities of interest. The Challenge is seeking solutions that assess socially isolated individuals and match them with appropriate technology tools and social engagement programming that best meet their needs. The winning solution will become part of a public-private campaign to reach up to 10 million socially isolated older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans.  Successful solutions will build from existing assessments, technology tools, and utilize state of the art matching algorithms to address the following topic area:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic Area: Increase Awareness and Use of Technology and Social Engagement Programming Through an Accessible Social Engagement Clearinghouse</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Create an accessible technology and social engagement clearinghouse that catalogs and links the array of technology, apps and social engagement programming resources.</li>\n  <li>Allow consumers to be matched to appropriate technology tools and programs based on their identified needs, interests, and abilities. This will require the design of a consumer interface and a user friendly assessment process that can inform the development of algorithms to match individuals to technology tools and social engagement programming that would best meet their needs and interests.</li>\n  <li>Design a user centered process to enable a seamless end to end experience for an individual in identifying, acquiring/accessing and using appropriate solutions to address their social isolation. This would include making informed decisions on options, enrolling into selected programs, acquiring technology, and securing training necessary to use selected solutions. The Social Engagement Clearinghouse will be interoperable, enable real-time indicators on program, technology and service availability, and enable assessment and screening information to be pushed by the consumer to their provider(s) of choice or whoever is supporting their care needs.</li>\n  <li>Propose a mechanism to include and update user reviews and other information about usability, quality, accessibility and availability of social engagement programming and technology tools that informs individual decisions about which products to select.</li>\n  <li>Pilot the use of the assessment and clearinghouse in a variety of settings including Aging and Disability Resource Centers.</li>\n  <li>The user interface of prototypes should be designed with a feedback loop to continue to assess quality and accessibility of experience during the pilot.</li>\n  <li>Evaluation of the pilot should also include the performance of the matching algorithms, the ability of the individual to enroll in selected social engagement programs and acquire the selected technology, and the impact the selected social engagement programs and technology tools have had on increasing the individual’s level of social engagement (i.e. reducing social isolation).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this challenge should include a team of key stakeholders with relevant technical expertise as well as knowledge in technologies and programs that address social isolation. Preference will be given to teams that coordinate with or are informed by a state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/vdc.html\">ADRC/No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a>. Since 2003, states and community-based organizations (CBOs) have invested in state NWDs to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD systems include a community-based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge will compete in two phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase.

            "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing the Rural Tech Project (Challenge), a new challenge supported with funds reserved under Title IV, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) for purposes of technical assistance and capacity building to support Title IV, Part A. The Challenge invites rural high schools to bring innovative solutions to the implementation of distance learning-enabled, competency-based technology instruction to prepare students for postsecondary education and careers in the technology workforce of today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge seeks solutions that use distance learning to provide rural communities access to competency-based education (CBE) programs in technology-related career pathways with a goal of increasing instructional capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Rural communities often lack the instructional capacity to deliver high-quality career and technical education (CTE) in technology education pathways. Distance learning- enabled models can help address capacity constraints by facilitating education delivery with limited staff and minimal or no in-person interaction among instructors or peers, which provides for the potential to increase access to in-demand technology career pathways in rural communities. CBE models allow students to progress at their own pace through a sequence of personalized learning experiences, where students advance their education by demonstrating mastery of a subject or concept. Expanding these models to rural high school students, with a focus on technology pathways, would increase access to qualified educators and expand opportunities for students to earn industry certifications and credentials. The progress of the finalists and the models and practices emerging from the Challenge will be shared on the Challenge website.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-descriptions\">Phase Descriptions</h4>\n\n<p>The Challenge will be conducted in two phases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 1: Open Submissions (June 30 - October 8, 2020)</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>During Phase 1, high schools and local educational agencies (LEAs) enter the Challenge by completing the submission process outlined on the Challenge webpage. Schools should coordinate their entries with their LEAs to ensure the entries represent an aligned effort, if applicable. At least one online informational session will be held during Phase 1.</li>\n      <li><strong>Judging:</strong> Entrants who fulfill the criteria described in the Eligibility section of this announcement and complete a submission that meets all entry requirements in the Submission Information section of this announcement will be eligible for judging. Independent judges will review eligible Phase 1 submissions using the Finalist Selection Criteria, which are included in the Award Selection Criteria section of this announcement and will recommend finalists to the Department. Up to five finalists will be selected from the group of eligible entrants and invited to participate in Phase 2.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 2: Community Implementation (January 2021 - August 2023)</strong>  </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>During Phase 2, finalists will have the opportunity to receive curated and customized technical assistance to finalize their proposed program plans in preparation for implementation. With support from a local community engagement manager selected by the entrant, finalists will launch programs for a first cohort of students. Finalists will collect data on the first cohorts’ performance metrics, identifying successes and opportunities for improvement. Finalists will evolve program designs and implement program changes while continuing to receive technical assistance. Finalists will also create sustainability plans.

The goal of this challenge is to find and demonstrate innovative solutions that remove or transport the amount of sediment building up in the reservoirs, replacing available space for water storage, that provide critical water supplies for the country. The build-up of sediment leaves less room for water, and less water means that our reservoirs eventually may not be able to meet the demand of the communities we serve. Such impacts have been experienced at some Reclamation reservoirs and are anticipated to occur more frequently in the future.  Reclamation’s primary interest is in technology that will move sediment downstream at the average annual rate at which it would otherwise accumulate but approaches that can help regain lost reservoir capacity are of interest if they can do so in addition to meeting environmental and other performance criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the competition here: <a href=\"http://www.herox.com/GuardiansoftheReservoir\">http://www.herox.com/GuardiansoftheReservoir</a>.</p>\n",

OTT’s mission is to expand the commercial impact and public benefit of DOE’s research and development portfolio to advance the economic, energy, and national security interests of the Nation. </p>\n\n<p>Energy startups and innovative technologies are critical to the growth of the energy economy in the United States and abroad. Startups drive technology development, business model innovation, and job creation. The private sector has had difficulty providing sufficient capital, business development services, and entrepreneurial training to early-stage, high-risk, longer-term, capital-intensive technologies, like those required for transforming the nation’s energy systems. </p>\n\n<p>Strong business incubation services—including, but not limited to, mentoring, entrepreneurial training, access to testing and prototyping assistance—not only provide direct support for early-stage startups, but also have the potential to de-risk the startups for follow-on investors. Incubators have the potential to accelerate regional economic development, strengthen national innovation capacity, and expand domestic energy-related manufacturing. By providing due diligence, screening applicant companies, assisting with prototyping, connecting entrepreneurs with manufacturers, and advising startups to prudently use their capital on vital services, incubators play a critical role in supporting startups as they transition into the market.</p>\n\n<p>The EPIC prize seeks to recognize the most novel, comprehensive, and impactful incubator plans that focus on developing strong innovation clusters, connections, and support for energy-related technology and entrepreneurial innovation. Prize competitors will develop a strategic plan to create or bolster innovation clusters through regional engagement, including engagement of other private actors—both for- and non-profit—as well as state and local entities that can provide additional resources. \nThe prize seeks to address a capital gap in supporting these critical organizations by providing funds to be applied where incubators need them most. Providing capital to enable creative, forward-thinking organizations is critical to allow organizations to think more expansively about the role of incubators in the broader regional and national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Further, it is DOE’s hope that this funding will enable winners of this prize to enhance their organization’s resilience and operational sustainability.</p>\n",

However, fertilizers applied without consideration of the appropriate rate, timing, source, and method, can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other next generation product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-details\">Challenge Details</h4>\n\n<p>To help mitigate potential adverse environmental effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the Joint EPA-USDA Partnership and Competition on Next Gen Fertilizers to Advance Agricultural Sustainability in the United States. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is in collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA).</p>\n\n<p>This Partnership is being coordinated with input from stakeholders such as corn grower representatives, fertilizer companies, university and government researchers, and environmental and industry NGOs. This competition includes two challenges which aim to accelerate the development and use of existing and new product technologies that are affordable to reduce the environmental impacts of U.S. corn production. The results of the Partnership may ultimately be leveraged to improve production of other crops under a range of environmental conditions in the U.S. and abroad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge:</strong> This Challenge aims to identify concepts for novel technologies for fertilizers and other product technology innovations that can reduce the environmental effects from modern agriculture while maintaining or increasing crop yields.

            "description": "<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n\n<p>Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers facilitate the growth of crops, including corn, at yields that provide sustained global food production. However, fertilizers applied without consideration of the appropriate rate, timing, source, and method, can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Details</strong></p>\n\n<p>To help mitigate potential adverse environmental effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the Joint EPA-USDA Partnership and Competition on Next Gen Fertilizers to Advance Agricultural Sustainability in the United States. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is in collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA).</p>\n\n<p>This Partnership is being coordinated with input from stakeholders such as corn grower representatives, fertilizer companies, university and government researchers, and environmental and industry NGOs. This competition includes two challenges which aim to accelerate the development and use of existing and new product technologies that are affordable to reduce the environmental impacts of U.S. corn production. The results of the Partnership may ultimately be leveraged to improve production of other crops under a range of environmental conditions in the U.S. and abroad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EEFs: Environmental and Agronomic Challenge:</strong> This Challenge aims to identify existing EEFs currently on or near-market that meet or exceed certain environmental and agro-economic criteria. The Challenge is planned to have 3 stages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stage 1: Potential solvers will submit information describing the EEF and how it is anticipated to meet the requirements. Submissions will be reviewed by an expert judging panel.</li>\n  <li>Stage 2: A subset of Stage 1 solvers will be invited to submit physical products in order to compete in planned greenhouse testing.</li>\n  <li>Stage 3: Potential for field trials following Stage 2 greenhouse testing, locations to be determined.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the challenge dealing with concepts for novel technologies for fertilizers and other product technology innovations, go to the <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/next-gen-fertilizer-innovations-challenge/\">Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates:</h4>\n\n<p>EEF Environmental and Agronomic Challenge Dates:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Launch: 9:00 AM ET August 26, 2020</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://next_gen_fertilizer_challenges.eventbrite.com/\">Informational Webinar</a>:  10:00 AM ET September 24, 2020 </li>\n  <li>Submission End: 11:59 PM ET October 30, 2020</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: Winter 2020/2021 (date and time to be determined)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information please visit EPA’s page for the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/innovation/next-gen-fertilizer-challenges\">Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges</a>.</p>\n",

            "judging": "<h4 id=\"judging-panel\">Judging Panel</h4>\n\n<p>A panel of subject matter experts selected by EPA, USDA and the Challenge collaborators will judge submissions based on pre-defined scoring criteria. The panel will initially screen submissions for completeness and relevance. The selected eligible applications will then be judged using the criteria specified below. Judges will be selected based on several criteria, including their technical expertise (e.g. chemistry, agronomy, microbiology, biogeochemistry, ecology), geography (e.g. Midwest, South, etc.), associations with land grant universities, sectoral experience (e.g. farming, academia, government, industry), and diversity. All judges will be required to sign Conflict of Interest (COI) agreement to ensure unbiased reviews, and Non-Disclosure agreements to ensure confidentiality of any CBI. All persons or entities that submit a solution will be notified as to the status of their submission and a high-level evaluation. Decisions cannot be contested.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"judging-criteria\">Judging Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>For Stage 1, the Judging Panel will evaluate submissions based on four performance areas, which will be allotted points (up to a total of 100). Submissions invited to Stage 2 will submit a physical product for testing at the IFDC based on agreed-upon protocols (see “Helpful Resources”).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scoring Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Within performance areas, there are additional criteria that will be evaluated. For example, there are five environmental and three agronomic criteria:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Environmental performance: 35 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching/runoff: 7 points</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching/runoff: 7 points</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization: 7 points</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions: 7 points</li>\n      <li>No toxic residue left on the field or in the runoff or leachate: 7 points (For the purposes of this Challenge, “toxic residues” refers to prevalent and biologically active degradates formed from decomposition (via either biotic and abiotic processes) of the product in the environment. Toxicity and prevalence can be described by a number of means, including existing eco-toxicology and environmental fate studies, summaries from either the EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard or the EPA Ecotox Knowledge base, or whether the constituent chemicals are already listed under the EPA’s Safer Chemical Ingredients List (e.g., there are 63 polymers listed as safer alternatives). Although this criteria does not pertain to inhibitor effects on target organisms (e.g., soil bacteria), which are toxic by design, it does pertain to any decomposition byproducts of inhibitors and other potential solutions, and effects that may occur for non-target organisms)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Agronomic performance: 35 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield relative to conventional fertilizer: 15 points</li>\n      <li>Return on investment (ROI): 10 points</li>\n      <li>Compatibility with existing supply chain machinery and practices: 10 points</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Other performance criteria: 20 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Addresses multiple loss pathways: 10 points</li>\n      <li>Applicability to other crops and environmental conditions: 5 points</li>\n      <li>Market penetration: 5 points</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Expert discretion points: 10 points</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Judging Panel will assign points to metrics and criteria based on the rubric above and their combined expert judgement given the degree of information submitted in the solutions. This “scorecard” will be made available to the Solver at the announcement of Stage 1 winners.</p>\n\n<p>The example rubric above is for a solution that addresses N and P. For solutions that address only one nutrient (e.g. N), the possible points for the other nutrient (e.g. P) will be zeroed out such that the total points possible will be less than 100 (i.e. 90 points possible for N-only solution, 80 total points possible for P-only solution).</p>\n\n<p>As an example, the following are qualities of an ideal solution:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Compatible with existing corn farming machinery and practices;</li>\n  <li>Reduces N and P leaching and runoff by 45% or more;</li>\n  <li>Reduces NH3 volatilization by 25% or more;</li>\n  <li>Reduces N2O emissions by 25% or more;</li>\n  <li>Does not leave any toxic residue after degradation;</li>\n  <li>Increases yield;</li>\n  <li>Is estimated to be a net profit for farmers (i.e. the revenue from yield increases offset the up-front cost increases for the new technology);</li>\n  <li>Has good environmental and agronomic performance under a range of environmental conditions;</li>\n  <li>Is widely available and potentially applicable to other crops.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 2.</strong> The planned IFDC trials are designed to evaluate a key subset of the criteria and metrics above. The greenhouse and laboratory trials will yield information on four environmental and three agronomic criteria. We will use a similar scoring rubric as with Stage 1, but with modifications since the IFDC trials will not test for certain criteria (e.g. toxicity of residue, compatibility with existing machinery).</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Environmental performance: 50 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Agronomic performance: 50 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield relative to conventional fertilizer</li>\n      <li>Nitrogen use efficiency</li>\n      <li>Phosphorus use efficiency</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Draft protocols for the planned IFDC greenhouse tests are available by request.

            "description": "<p>The US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA) is announcing the xTech Brain Operant Learning Technology – xTechBOLT – prize competition.  The prize competition is designed to incentivize industry to develop and demonstrate the use of one or more tool(s) (e.g., QEEG, fMRI, MEG, BIOMRK, NIRS, PET, MEA, SPECT, or other) to locate, track, and trace four types of learning traits, including explicit and implicit knowledge, from exposure to storage, and use those neural pathways to capture emotions and empathy and research a proof of concept mechanism (software or hardware, or both) that could be developed to promote optimal retention and access to memories.</p>\n\n<p>The goals for this competition are to understand the effects of emotion and empathy on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional and empathetic processing and effect on both implicit and explicit learning.  Understanding these effects will help build the United States Military of the future, by revolutionizing how we teach and train Warfighters, how we build better medical providers, and how we utilize novel brain operant learning technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The Army (and more broadly the U.S. Department of Defense) seek “path finding” teams and technologies through this competition. Therefore, xTechBOLT is not interested in low-risk, repackaged approaches of tried and true techniques. We aim to find early-stage innovations with the potential to dramatically improve military training outcomes with novel hardware- and/or software-based technologies.</p>\n\n<p>xTechBOLT is seeking applicants to use one or more tool(s) (e.g., QEEG, fMRI, MEG, BIOMRK, NIRS, PET, MEA, SPECT, or other) to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Locate, track, and trace four types of learning traits including explicit and implicit knowledge from exposure to storage, and use those neural pathways to capture emotions and empathy from exposure to storage;</li>\n  <li>Research a proof of concept technology which may include software or hardware, or both that could be developed to promote optimal retention and access to memories.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Army recognizes that it must enhance engagements with innovative problem solvers, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies under development commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating small business innovators into the Army’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>\n\n<p>The xTechBOLT competition will provide increasing non-dilutive prizes to select applicants to proceed in the competition.  All applications will be reviewed by Army subject matter experts and up to 10 applicants with the highest ranking concept white papers will receive a prize of $10,000 each and advance to give a pitch on their proposed concept to a live Army judging panel.  The live judging panel will select five (5) applicants to receive additional awards of $25,000 each and be invited to present a proof-of-concept of their technology solutions at the 2021 Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) in Orlando, Florida.  Out of those five (5) finalists, a grand prize winner will be selected and awarded an additional $500,000 prize.  The remaining finalists will receive prizes as follows: Second place - $125,000.00, Third place – $75,000.00, Fourth place - $50,000.00, Fifth place - $25,000.00.

Receive timely updates on CTE Mission: CubeSat by signing up for the newsletter.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"about-the-challenge\">About the Challenge</h4>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is announcing CTE Mission: CubeSat (the Challenge), a Challenge funded by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 as amended by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V). The Challenge calls upon eligible high schools to design and build CubeSat prototypes.</p>\n\n<p>The specifications of CubeSats that were adopted by the commercial satellite industry reduce the time and cost to design, build, and launch a satellite, making orbital missions more accessible for both commercial and educational use. For the purpose of this Challenge, and to reduce production time, high schools will be encouraged to build a CubeSat Prototype using more accessible, low-fidelity materials (e.g., 3D-printed material, wood, plastic, or other materials) that meet the standard CubeSat dimensions adopted by industry and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>\n\n<p>A CubeSat Prototype can be flown and tested using various flight methods that effectively simulate a low-altitude launch, such as, but not limited to, tethered balloons, amateur rockets, drones, or small aircraft.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"why-participate\">Why Participate</h4>\n\n<p>By participating in the Challenge, students and educators will gain an understanding of the phases involved in designing, building, and launching a satellite. The Challenge focuses on select elements of the CubeSat development process to enable students to experience as much of the design, build, and flight stages on a timeline significantly shorter than NASA estimates to be typically 18-24 months to build a CubeSat and a few months to a few years to launch a CubeSat into orbit.\nUsing CubeSat Prototypes, rather than space-ready CubeSats, enables schools to participate in the Challenge and conduct a test flight without the need for design and testing approvals that CubeSats entering orbit require.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-descriptions\">Phase Descriptions</h4>\n\n<p>The Challenge will be conducted in two phases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 1 Mission Design (August – December 2020):</strong></p>\n\n    <p>Potential entrants will receive support through curated and customized online resources as they develop their Mission Proposals and consider various flight methods to launch their CubeSat Prototypes (e.g., balloons, drones, or other locally available launch vehicles). At least one online information session will be held during this phase.  Potential entrants may enter the Challenge by submitting a Mission Proposal that will include descriptions of objectives, materials needed, plans for prototyping, proposed flight method, and team details.</p>\n\n    <p>Entrants who fulfill the criteria described in the <a href=\" https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/eligibility/\">Eligibility section</a> and complete a submission that meets the requirements of a Mission Proposal will be eligible to proceed into the judging process, and if selected, participate in Phase 2 as a finalist.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Judging:</strong> Independent judges will review Mission Proposals using the <em>Finalist Selection Criteria</em>, which are included in the <em>Judging Criteria</em> section of this notice and make recommendations to the Department as to which entrants should be selected as finalists. Up to five finalists will be selected from the group of eligible entrants based on submitted Mission Proposals and invited to participate in Phase 2.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 2 Mission Build and Launch (January – May 2021):</strong></p>\n\n    <p>During Phase 2, finalists will implement their Mission Proposal by building a CubeSat Prototype and planning flight events where they will each launch their prototype using their proposed flight method. Finalists will receive mentorship and additional virtual resources to support them throughout the self-paced mission build process. Flight events must be conducted by the date and time determined by the Department which will be published on the Challenge webpage. Following the flight event, finalists will submit a Flight Report that includes a detailed description of the flight experience, results, lessons learned, flight data, visual documentation (e.g., photographs and/or videos), a detailed flight event planning checklist, a description of the functional CubeSat Prototype, a description of other devices and equipment required for their selected flight method, and a project budget.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Judging:</strong> Independent judges may review Flight Reports using the <em>Winner Selection Criteria</em>, which are included in the <em>Judging Criteria</em> section of this notice and make recommendations to the Department as to which finalists should be selected as winners based on submitted Flight Reports.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n",

The challenge asks Solvers to submit detailed plans for a non-thermal way of destroying PFAS in concentrated aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), while creating the least amount of potentially harmful byproducts.</p>\n\n<p>PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used for more than 60 years to make plastics, firefighting foams, and lubricants, and to help make products stain-resistant, waterproof, and nonstick. Addressing and managing PFAS in the environment is one of the most pressing issues facing EPA and its partners. This issue is particularly challenging because PFAS chemicals have a very strong carbon-fluorine chemical bond that leads to persistence in the environment and makes their complete destruction extremely difficult. Given the ubiquitous nature of PFAS and increasing public concerns, EPA and its partners are looking for greater certainty when making decisions about disposal and treatment of PFAS containing materials and PFAS contaminated media/waste.</p>\n\n<p>Although PFAS compounds can be found at different concentrations in various waste streams including aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), biosolids, ground water, sludge and soil, the challenge is focused on unused AFFF. Currently, EPA is investigating all methods of destroying PFAS. Incineration has been used to treat PFAS-contaminated media, and EPA scientists are collaborating with the private sector to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies to completely destroy PFAS. The goal of this challenge is to discover new non-thermal technologies and approaches that remove at least 99 percent of PFAS in unused AFFF while preventing the creation of harmful byproducts.</p>\n",

            "description": "<h4 id=\"overview\">Overview</h4>\n\n<p>The Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is hosting the Enhancing Computer Vision for Public Safety Challenge focused on advancing the capacity of no-reference (NR) metrics and computer vision algorithms for image and video quality analysis, to support public safety missions. PSCR will award prizes valued up to $240,000 to winning contestants. The First Responders Network Authority is partnering with PSCR on this challenge. The contestants will provide: 1) datasets of images or videos showing impairments that cause computer vision applications to fail, and 2) innovative methods to estimate the failure rate of computer vision algorithms on these images or videos. These solutions will provide the computer vision and NR metric research communities training datasets to ultimately improve analytics for public safety.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-background\">Challenge Background</h4>\n\n<p>A roadblock to the deployment of public safety computer vision and video analytics is the myriad problems cameras have when deployed in real world environments.</p>\n\n<p>First responders operate in environments that are very challenging for cameras. Frequently problems include low light, night with bright lights, and the rising or setting sun shining directly into the camera. Obscurants like rain, snow, and airborne dust obscure distant objects. Bodycams and in-car cameras produce severe camera jiggle. First responders often rely on a third party’s outdated camera systems that provide low resolution video feeds or low-quality compression. Lenses may be obscured by spider webs, restaurant grease, or other grime. First responders need robust computer vision systems that can operate in these difficult environments.</p>\n\n<p>To develop robust systems for public safety, computer vision researchers need an algorithm that predicts the quality of images and videos and performs root cause analysis (RCA). These are referred to as NR metric for image quality assessment (IQA) or video quality assessment (VQA). The NR metric would supplement the camera feed with extra information, such as noting areas of the image where the camera cannot “see.” Deployed systems could implement complex strategies, such as dynamically selecting the optimal video analytic or adjusting camera settings.</p>\n\n<p>Today, NR metrics emulate the human perceptual system. This requires subjective testing, where large groups of people assess the quality of images or videos, so the training datasets are small and expensive. Consequently, NR metrics are too inaccurate for computer vision applications. An additional problem is that most NR metrics only predict overall quality. Computer vision applications need RCA to identify and respond to specific image and video quality problems. Therefore, PSCR is seeking image and video datasets to train NR metric RCA algorithms, as well as strategies for creating this training data. The dataset creation strategies could enable a new line of research.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-goals-and-objectives\">Challenge Goals and Objectives</h4>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to enhance the research capacity of NR metrics, computer vision algorithms, and image quality analysis for public safety officials. This challenge also seeks to convene members of these disparate research communities to advance the state of image and video quality analysis for public safety.</p>\n\n<p>PSCR hypothesizes that developing new training datasets for NR metric research can replace expensive subjective testing with accuracy estimates from computer vision algorithms. This will help PSCR achieve the development of robust image and video analytics for public safety applications. Each dataset solution can either focus on a Specific Camera Impairment (e.g., lens flare) or a Specific Computer Vision Application (e.g., automated driving). Each dataset will include the following elements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>250+ images or videos (5 seconds duration or less) that portray a wide range of visual quality, subject matter, and environmental conditions</li>\n  <li>Numerical data that estimates the likelihood that a computer vision application will fail</li>\n  <li>Category data that can be used to subdivide the images into useful subsets</li>\n  <li>A short document that describes the dataset and assessment method</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After the challenge, the datasets will be used for image quality research and development (R&amp;D) purposes. This will provide the research community with valuable datasets. If the contestant chooses to distribute the images or videos, the datasets will be distributed via the National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) Consumer Digital Video Library (CDVL). NTIA, a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, conducts NR metric research and provides PSCR with video quality assessment expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Contestants will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Create and distribute a set of images or videos (5 seconds duration or less) that represent either a) one Specific Camera Impairment with content suitable for various computer vision applications, or b) a variety of camera impairments with content suitable for a Single Computer Vision Application. All images and videos must be from modern cameras (i.e., no synthetic or simulated impairments). At the contestant’s discretion, these images or videos will be freely distributed for research and development purposes following the conclusion of the challenge.</li>\n  <li>Create a method to assess the failure rates of a specific computer vision algorithm and apply this method to the contestant’s images or videos. Possible solutions include but are not limited to correct classification rate, misclassification rate, likelihood score, image ambiguity, image difficulty, and meta-recognition. The failure rates must be expressed as a percentage or fraction. The method must be described in sufficient detail that another researcher or developer could apply the method to their own images or videos, using their own computer vision algorithm. At the contestant’s discretion, the contestant may optionally identify areas of the image or video where the computer vision algorithm fails.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For this challenge, failure rate is whether or not the computer vision algorithm can make a reliable decision. Contestants should choose a method to assess failure rate that is synergistic with this challenge’s goal of understanding how camera impairments impact computer vision algorithms. Contestants should apply the reliability measure that is most appropriate to the application of choice based on the current state of the art. Of most interest are (a) failure rate assessment methods that can be applied to any computer vision system, and (b) failure rate assessment methods designed for computer vision algorithms that specifically target public safety and first responder needs.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phases\">Phases</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Concept Paper</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Concept Paper phase invites all eligible contestants to submit a concept paper outlining their proposed solution, approach, capabilities, knowledge, and skills for this contest. Contestants must document their proposed solution structure for either of the two dataset categories. Contestants will also need to demonstrate their experience with image quality analysis, video quality analysis, computer vision, engineering, photography, or other abilities to create the proposed solution. Contestants who propose using a computer vision algorithm to create assessment data will need to demonstrate their experience with computer vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Dataset Submission</strong></p>\n\n<p>During Phase 2 of the challenge, invited contestants will implement their proposals and submit datasets according to the Requirements below. Datasets will consist of images or videos that contain different scenes or different impairments to quality. The datasets will also include a computer vision failure rate for each image or video, and a general description of how the failure rates were derived. During evaluation, the Judging panel will score each submission based on the evaluation criteria.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"blob:https://www.challenge.gov/85a9bbf0-8e95-4bf8-8e44-747d5f035d45\" alt=\"Challenge Timeline\" title=\"Challenge Timeline\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of Important Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1, Concept Paper</strong>: Open for submissions beginning September 8, 2020, with concept papers due October 20, 2020; Winners will be notified by October 30, 2020.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2, Dataset Submission</strong>: Open for submissions on November 3, 2020, with datasets due May 4, 2021; Winners will be notified by May 19, 2021.</p>\n",

These updates will be reviewed at the MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge webinar on August 12, 2020.  A link to register for the webinar is included below.</h4>\n\n<p>This year, we’ve been forced to rethink the myriad of different ways we connect, socialize and interact with each other. In the absence of face-to-face time, can technology and online tools help us make, maintain, and strengthen those connections so vital to everyday life? We believe they can. That’s why we need your help.</p>\n\n<p>Can you design an easy-to-use online directory of social engagement programs and technology tools and products that matches end-users who are socially isolated with customized suggestions, tailored to meet their specific needs, interests, and abilities, in one seamless end-to-end experience? Then we want to hear from you.</p>\n\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL) along with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, are offering up to $750,000 in prizes and an opportunity to reach up to 10 million Americans. The prize will be awarded to the winner at the CES in January 2021. ACL and OASH are joined by the Consumer Technology Association Foundation (CTA Foundation), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in promoting the competition and judging and/or evaluating the submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Are you up to the challenge? Learn more about the competition and how to apply below.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"backgroundissue\">Background/Issue</h4>\n\n<p>The number of people in the United States aged 65 or older will almost double from 49 million in 2020 to 95 million by the year 2060 comprising nearly one quarter of the total US population. Among the senior population, nearly 25% of Americans aged 65-and-over are considered to be socially isolated - “the objective state of having few social relationships or infrequent social contact with others” - while 43% of those 60-and-over report feeling lonely.</p>\n\n<p>A constellation of harmful health outcomes have been associated with isolation and loneliness including premature mortality, a higher risk for developing dementia, heart failure and stroke, and increased risk of hospitalizations. In light of these health risk factors, it is unsurprising that analyses of Medicare spending has revealed an additional $6.7 billion spent annually on enrollees who are socially isolated.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance in fostering the development of innovative solutions to combat the harmful effects of these risk factors and the role technology has in addressing social isolation and loneliness, in March 2019, the White House National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released a report on “Emerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population.”</p>\n\n<p>The challenges brought forth by social isolation and loneliness has come to the fore during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  As the nation continues to adhere to public health recommendations of social distancing, an increasingly recognized secondary outcome is the risk social distancing can have on rates of loneliness and social isolation especially among our nation’s most vulnerable populations including older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes and our nation’s Veterans population.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>While there are an array of technologies and social engagement programs in the marketplace, there are considerable gaps in both awareness of and access to these technologies and programming for those individuals most likely to be lonely and isolated. Consequently, there is an opportunity to increase access and awareness to technologies and social engagement programming.</p>\n\n<p>ACL and OASH are pleased to announce the <strong>M</strong>obilizing and <strong>E</strong>mpowering the <strong>N</strong>ation and <strong>T</strong>echnology to <strong>A</strong>ddress <strong>L</strong>oneliness &amp; social isolation (MENTAL) Health Innovation Challenge to address this need. Supporting partners include the VA, FCC, and the CTA Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>With this health innovation challenge we hope to recognize innovative ideas and solutions that seek to develop a software platform that increases awareness of, access to and use of social engagement technologies and programming to help curtail the impact of loneliness and social isolation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge asks care partners, local communities, businesses, non-profit organizations, institutions, healthcare providers, technologists, academics, among others in the global community for innovative solutions to combat loneliness and social isolation in vulnerable populations including Veterans, older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes that may be isolated from visitors and family members during a quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to increase consumer awareness and use of technology tools that keep older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations, and Veterans socially engaged and connected to families, friends, communities and activities of interest. The Challenge is seeking solutions that assess socially isolated individuals and match them with appropriate technology tools and social engagement programming that best meet their needs. The winning solution will become part of a public-private campaign to reach up to 10 million socially isolated older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans.  Successful solutions will build from existing assessments, technology tools, and utilize state of the art matching algorithms to address the following topic area:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic Area: Increase Awareness and Use of Technology and Social Engagement Programming Through an Accessible Social Engagement Clearinghouse</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Create an accessible technology and social engagement clearinghouse that catalogs and links the array of technology, apps and social engagement programming resources.</li>\n  <li>Allow consumers to be matched to appropriate technology tools and programs based on their identified needs, interests, and abilities. This will require the design of a consumer interface and a user friendly assessment process that can inform the development of algorithms to match individuals to technology tools and social engagement programming that would best meet their needs and interests.</li>\n  <li>Design a user centered process to enable a seamless end to end experience for an individual in identifying, acquiring/accessing and using appropriate solutions to address their social isolation. This would include making informed decisions on options, enrolling into selected programs, acquiring technology, and securing training necessary to use selected solutions. The Social Engagement Clearinghouse will be interoperable, enable real-time indicators on program, technology and service availability, and enable assessment and screening information to be pushed by the consumer to their provider(s) of choice or whoever is supporting their care needs.</li>\n  <li>Propose a mechanism to include and update user reviews and other information about usability, quality, accessibility and availability of social engagement programming and technology tools that informs individual decisions about which products to select.</li>\n  <li>Pilot the use of the assessment and clearinghouse in a variety of settings including Aging and Disability Resource Centers.</li>\n  <li>The user interface of prototypes should be designed with a feedback loop to continue to assess quality and accessibility of experience during the pilot.</li>\n  <li>Evaluation of the pilot should also include the performance of the matching algorithms, the ability of the individual to enroll in selected social engagement programs and acquire the selected technology, and the impact the selected social engagement programs and technology tools have had on increasing the individual’s level of social engagement (i.e. reducing social isolation).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this challenge should include a team of key stakeholders with relevant technical expertise as well as knowledge in technologies and programs that address social isolation. Preference will be given to teams that coordinate with or are informed by a state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/vdc.html\">ADRC/No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a>. Since 2003, states and community-based organizations (CBOs) have invested in state NWDs to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD systems include a community-based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge will compete in two phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase.

Solutions must show publication-quality data demonstrating:</p> <ul> <li>A 3-D human retina organoid system that mimics the physiological and morphological features of the in vivo biology, consists of the major retina cell types (rod and cone photoreceptors, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells and Muller glia) with appropriate lamination and synaptic organization, and represents their biological functions and interplay. Components (neurons, retinal pigment epithelium [RPE], glia) may be produced separately or dissociated and recombined (1) if protocol is driven by a valuable biological question and (2) if in the process of re-assembly, specific functions/roles of cell types are delineated. Three-dimensional assembly may be achieved using various approaches, for example through self-organization that recapitulates natural development (&ldquo;true organoid&rdquo;) or through bioengineering with scaffolds, bioprinting, and/or microfluidic apparatuses.</li> <li>Retina organoids that are generated entirely from human cells (e.g. derived from iPSCs, hESCs, multipotent cells, or adult cells subjected to a combination of transdifferentiation/reprogramming methods).</li> <li>Modeling and treating retinal disease, or testing and developing drug (i.e., high content screening) therapies.</li> <li>Find detailed evaluation criteria <a href=\"https://www.nei.nih.gov/about/goals-and-accomplishments/nei-research-initiatives/3-d-retina-organoid-challenge-3-d-roc/3-d-roc-2020-reduction-practice-challenge\">here</a>&nbsp;under \"Evaluation and Winner Selection\"</li> </ul> <p>Explants are not of interest for this Challenge. Tissue-on-a-chip systems that use cells grown in 2-D co-culture and do not fully represent the structure, morphology, and function of the human retina are also not of interest. However, creative approaches that incorporate use of microfluidics or perfusion to enhance culture or extend duration of survival for 3-D organoid systems are acceptable.</p> <p>Reviewers will be asked to use the following criteria when evaluating whether (in the form of results, graphs, images, etc.) a prototype 3-D human retina organoid meets evaluation criteria:</p> <ul> <li>Significant advances over currently available protocols in areas such as duration of culture, yield, and maturity/differentiation of all cell types in appropriate numbers and ratio.</li> <li>Potential impact on understanding the biology of the retina.</li> </ul> </div>\n",

Impact and Innovation (20 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">20%</strong> </h4> <p>Solutions will be evaluated for creativity and originality of designs. An innovative approach may be novel, groundbreaking, or paradigm-shifting, or a creative application of existing approaches. For Phase 1 submissions, the approach should also be feasible; i.e., have a high likelihood to succeed in meeting or exceeding the scientific evaluation criteria NEI has defined. Overall, the solution should provide a novel solution to building a 3-D human retina that meets the desired scientific criteria (structure, function, morphology). Reviewers will be asked to specifically&nbsp;address:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Impact on potential end users, clinical implications, and therapeutic advances &mdash;To what extent will the solution exert a sustained, powerful influence on the understanding of retinal diseases and accelerating research toward new&nbsp;therapies?</li> <li>To what extent does the solution address a significant barrier in the development of human retina organoids that are highly representative of human physiology? Does the approach speed up organoid development and differentiation time, improve yield, or increase&nbsp;production?</li> <li>How is the solution unique and does it improve upon state of the science for organoid&nbsp;technology?</li> <li>To what extent are novel concepts, approaches, methodologies, technologies or instrumentation used, or are existing approaches applied in a novel&nbsp;way?</li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 2. Cell Types, Structure, and Function (25 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">25%</strong> </h4> Solutions will be evaluated for establishment of a human PSC-derived in vitro retina model system that resembles the morphology of a healthy-native retina and is viable through formation of photoreceptor outer segments and/or long-term survival of retinal ganglion cells with extension of axonal processes. Reviewers will be asked to address:&nbsp;Cell Types:&nbsp;How many neuronal (or neuronal derived) cell types are stably co-cultured (rod and cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells, Muller glia)? Are long-term viable and functional RPE, choroid or non-neuronal cell types (e.g., pericytes, microglia, astrocytes) incorporated? To what extent does the evidence presented show presence of cell types and 3-dimensional structure. If a cell type is lacking, is there justification for why it is not present and not needed for proof of principle (i.e. the disease being modelled lacks the specific cell type)?  Structure:&nbsp;Are organoid prototypes 3-dimensional and properly oriented? To what extent do the synaptic layers recapitulate those of a laminated retina with multiple neuron classes present in numbers and proportions that represent an in vivo setting (as indicated by biomarkers of lineage and differentiation)? How many other retina and retina-relevant tissues, cells, or structures are included?  Functional characterization of cell types:&nbsp;Are all cell types in the organoid (or added to the organoid) functional through the latest viable timepoint as shown by appropriate analyses, including electrophysiology (e.g., light response and recovery for subsequent responses, etc.), retinoid recycling, cell communication, functional connectivity, fluid transport in RPE, etc.? </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 3. Reproducibility, Quality Control, and Standardization (25 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">25%</strong> </h4> Assessment of inter/intra-laboratory utility, transferability, and reproducibility, with conclusive evidence that organoid prototype is based on a reproducible protocol and the protocol produces a relatively standardized product. Reproducibility:&nbsp;To what extent do the data support reproducibility and standardization (e.g., data showing transferability to other labs and lack of variability from batch to batch) included?  To what extent is documentation of standardization or commercialization highlighted (i.e. cGMP protocols or patent applications)? Are the methods (part of the Appendix) sufficiently detailed such that the efforts could be reproduced (e.g., Standard operating protocols)?  Robustness:&nbsp;How do the data support advances in organoid development to decrease differentiation time, improve yield, or increase production?  Have retina organoids been characterized to show they are free of microbial contamination and chromosomal defects (i.e. karyotyping, STR analysis, FISH analysis)?  Are formal documented agreements with industry, or transferability to industry partners (MOUs, licensing, CRADA, in-kind or discounted validation) presented? </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 4. Endpoint Assay Specific Goals (30 points for EITHER category) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">30%</strong> </h4> BIOLOGY/DISEASE MODELING (note:&nbsp;NEI is agnostic to which disease is chosen, as long as technology is developed to robustly recapitulate the disease):&nbsp;Does the organoid prototype demonstrate improvement in faithful biological complexity (e.g. macula, multiple cell subtypes present in physiologically similar ratios, etc.)?  Does the model recapitulate some aspect of disease phenotype in one or more assays?  Viability and scalability:&nbsp;If grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of organoids in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained? Are methods that increase the production (e.g., many dozens) of organoids and/or allow the distribution of well-characterized organoids presented to enable multiple organoids to be compared in the same experiment?  Is therapeutic intervention to treat the disease modelled with 3-D retina organoids (e.g. via gene editing, small molecules, cell replacement, etc.) demonstrated? HIGH CONTENT SCREENING:&nbsp;Are retina organoid prototypes amenable to high content screening, which may include high content imaging, drug validation/toxicology, or functional genomic screening (e.g. does not include materials known to show strong compound adsorption)? Does the model recapitulate known retina toxicities based on morphological and functional readouts? Scalability and portability:&nbsp;Are organoids grown at medium throughput (e.g., in a 96-well plate) robust? When grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of wells in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained? Are methods to mass-produce (e.g., 100s) organoids such that multiple plates can be compared in the same experiment included? </div> </div>\n",
