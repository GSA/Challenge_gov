These represent species and associated trophic levels most frequently tested when evaluating the ecological hazards of chemicals. While there are many extant, viable, technologies for measuring global gene expression, the significant technological leap and challenge to the solver community is to provide these capabilities at a cost and scale of commercial throughput that can accommodate the analysis of thousands or tens of thousands of samples per year.

The Challenge goal is to devise new ways of analyzing the large dataset from its Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to identify factors that impact maternal morbidity and severe maternal morbidity so that clinicians can more quickly and accurately identify and treat pregnancy-related conditions and prevent severe illness or death for a pregnant person. The total purse for the Challenge is $400,000.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subject of the Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each year in the United States, more than 50,000 women experience severe maternal morbidity (SMM), unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that result in significant short- or long-term health consequences, and many more experience maternal morbidity (MM), unexpected outcomes of labor and delivery that affect women’s health but are less significant. In addition, the United States has the highest ratio of maternal mortality among developed nations; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, as of 2019 there were 16.7 deaths per 100,000 live births, a number that has been increasing since the surveillance began in 1987. Large disparities exist based on race/ethnicity and other factors.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) mission is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. In support of this mission, NICHD conducted the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-be (nuMoM2b) to study nulliparous women, those for whom this pregnancy would lead to their first delivery. Potential adverse pregnancy outcomes among these women are less predictable because they have not given birth before and no prior data on how they respond to pregnancy is available. NuMoM2b began in 2010 and compiled data on more than 10,000 racially, ethnically, and geographically diverse participants. Data collection began in the 6th week of pregnancy and continued through delivery. Collected data include interviews, questionnaires, clinical measurements, patient charts, and biological specimens.</p>\n\n<p>Through the Decoding Maternal Morbidity Data Challenge, NICHD seeks innovative approaches to identify new areas of research on SMM and MM from the nuMoM2b dataset.

The federal government is a critical provider of open data to the public, with hundreds of thousands of datasets maintained by government agencies and made available on platforms such as data.gov.</p>\n\n<p>But open data on its own is not enough to deliver its full potential for Americans.  Federal open datasets need to be enabled through digital tools that put data at the fingertips of communities, businesses, families, and decision makers nationwide.  By engaging technologists and community members in creating tools with open data, government agencies can exponentially increase that data’s utility and value - and solve pressing national challenges. <strong>The Open Data for Good Grand Challenge seeks to reward the most creative and high impact uses of open data in digital tools that solve problems for the public</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>This Grand Challenge was inspired by <a href=\"https://go.usa.gov/x7m4Y\">The Opportunity Project </a>(TOP), a program of <a href=\"https://go.usa.gov/x7mjn\">Census Open Innovation Labs</a> at the U.S. Census Bureau, used by federal agencies to catalyze digital tools with open data.</p>\n\n<p>TOP sprints brings together government, communities, and technologists to create data-driven digital tools that address our nation’s greatest challenges using federal open data. Through 12-week development cycles, or “sprints,” technologists from industry and social sectors — including companies, nonprofits, and universities — create digital tools to address challenges such as family economic well being, climate change, COVID-19 response and many more.  To learn more about The Opportunity Project, visit <a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov\">opportunity.census.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Since launching in 2016, more than 20 federal agencies and over 1,500 individuals from companies, universities and community organizations have co-created nearly 150 new digital products for the public. In 2020 alone, participants co-created more than 30 new digital products addressing challenges in the natural and built environment—such as reducing ocean plastic pollution, developing effective and efficient markets for recycled materials, facilitating sustainable rural economic development, and more.</p>\n\n<p>TOP supports the Census Bureau’s mission and the OPEN Government Data Act mandate to identify and disseminate public data assets as well as utilize these public data assets to grow the economy, promote transparency, and make government data more useful and accessible to the public.  Both open data and The Opportunity Project as a mechanism to unleash its potential, are key components of the Federal Data Strategy and Department of Commerce Strategic Plan, which focus on utilizing data as an asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, promote transparency, and make government data more useful to the public, businesses, and researchers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-problem\">The Problem</h4>\n\n<p>One of the greatest challenges associated with public interest technology (or civic technology) development is product sustainability and adoption.  Open data is used to create many products for the public good, but the teams who built these products often face challenges in deploying and maintaining them.  To advance some of the most promising technology solutions built with open data, the Census Bureau and its collaborators are launching the Open Data for Good Grand Challenge.  This Challenge aims to 1) help technologists and their collaborators better deploy their data-driven technology solutions, ensure they reach end users, and drive impact of the critical problems they aim to solve, and 2) to reward exemplary uses of federal open data. \nThis challenge is open to:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Anyone who participated or participates in The Opportunity Project sprints or TOPx sprints in 2020 or 2021 (between the dates of 1/1/2020 and 10/24/2021).</li>\n  <li>Anyone in the general public who follows The Opportunity Project methodology via TOP’s public <a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov/product-development/toolkit/\">product development toolkit</a> to create a user-centered digital tool using federal open data in 2020 or 2021 (between the dates of 1/1/2020 and 10/24/2021).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Please refer to the eligibility section below for full details.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-goals-and-categories\">Challenge Goals and Categories</h4>\n\n<p>In this competition, prizes will be awarded in 3 main categories that capture a range of critical problems, as described below. <strong>Teams applying for the prize must submit their product in at least one category, and can submit in up to two categories</strong>.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Climate, Resilience, and the Natural Environment:</strong> e.g., products focusing on challenges such as reducing ocean plastic pollution, creating markets for recycled materials, enabling data for agricultural decision making, transportation emissions, air quality, community resilience to climate change, or other similar natural environment and climate challenges.</li>\n  <li><strong>Society, Economy, and the Built Environment:</strong> e.g., products focusing on challenges such as family economic well-being and economic security, rural economic development, civics education, supporting small and minority-owned businesses, analyzing federal spending, infrastructure planning around housing and migration trends, affordable housing, assisting resettled refugees, or other social and economic challenges.</li>\n  <li><strong>Health and COVID-19:</strong> e.g., products focused on challenges such as helping state and local public health authorities track and understand COVID-19, helping stakeholders working alongside healthcare make key operational decisions, and helping consumers and businesses manage point of care testing data outside lab settings, or other COVID-19 health-related challenges.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Please refer to the prizes section below for full details on prize opportunities within each category.</p>\n",

Through two contests, established perovskite researchers will launch a company and move toward commercialization in under a year.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the American-Made Challenges series, the Perovskite Startup Prize unites the world’s best-in-class research base with the unparalleled entrepreneurial support system of the <a href=\"https://americanmadechallenges.org/network/index.html\">American-Made Network</a>. Consisting of pioneering maker spaces, dozens of energy incubators, universities, and 17 U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories, the Network is primed to assist entrepreneurs in bringing perovskite-focused concepts to market.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Contests</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Perovskite Startup Prize consists of two consecutive contests that accelerate efforts to develop new, innovative perovskite solar companies with the potential to manufacture commercially viable products in the United States. The best-performing competitors in the Countdown Contest are awarded with cash prizes and are eligible to compete in the Lift-off Contest. This cycle of contests repeats until 2-3 final winners are selected for successfully completing the challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p>Below is a timeline of tentative submission deadlines for each quarter <em>(All dates subject to change).</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>March 25, 2021, 1:00 PM ET:</strong> Open for Countdown Submission</li>\n  <li><strong>June 30, 2021, 5:00 PM ET:</strong> Countdown Submission Deadline #1</li>\n  <li><strong>September 30, 2021, 5:00 PM ET:</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Countdown Submission Deadline #2</li>\n      <li>Liftoff Submission Deadline #1 (Liftoff– Must have won Countdown #2)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Jan. 4, 2022, 5:00 PM ET:</strong>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Countdown Submission Deadline #3</li>\n      <li>Liftoff Submission Deadline #2 (Liftoff – Must have won Countdown #1 or #2)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>March 31, 2022, 5:00 PM ET:</strong>  Liftoff Submission Deadline #4 (Liftoff – Must have won Countdown #1, #2, #3, or #4)</li>\n</ul>\n",

Only new, for-profit companies—whose date of incorporation is within six months prior to the announcement of this competition or any time after the announcement of the competition—are eligible to compete. DOE expects to select approximately six to nine companies that will receive $200,000 in cash and become eligible to compete in the Liftoff Contest. It is not expected that all winners will be selected in the first open-application period; the Countdown Contest has a rolling application period with quarterly submission deadlines. Participant submissions will be reviewed quarterly by a panel of expert reviewers from industry, the national laboratories, and the government. Participants who are not selected will be given feedback and encouraged to resubmit in future open-application periods. The DOE will announce when the Countdown Contest is over.</li>\n  <li><strong>Liftoff Contest</strong> – This contest will reward the achievement of substantial technical progress toward goals set in the Countdown Contest, while simultaneously establishing the critical business and research infrastructure the company will need to be successful. Only winners of the Countdown Contest may compete in the Liftoff Contest. Winners of the Countdown Contest are eligible to apply to the Liftoff Contest within 12 months of winning the Countdown prize. Over the length of this prize competition, DOE expects to select approximately two to three companies that will receive $500,000 in cash and $100,000 in vouchers redeemable at national laboratories and qualified service providers. Liftoff Contest competitors who do not win on their first attempt will have one more opportunity to apply to compete in the Liftoff Contest within 15 months of winning the Countdown prize. Competitors who are not selected twice or are outside of these time windows will not be eligible to compete for the Liftoff prize. The Liftoff Contest will end when the prize pool is exhausted, regardless of whether all Countdown winners have applied to enter the Liftoff Contest. Liftoff Contest submissions will be reviewed quarterly by a panel of expert reviewers from industry, the national laboratories, and the government.</li>\n</ol>\n",

To the full extent permissible pursuant to applicable law, Conservation X Labs, its contractors, its coalition partners, and its Funders, as well as the directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers of each expressly disclaim any warranties, express implied, statutory, or otherwise, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for any particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>\n\n<p>(b) Under no circumstances will Conservation X Labs, its contractors, its coalition partners, and its Funders, and their directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, or suppliers of either, will be liable for any special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary damages arising from participation in this competition, including the use of its website or platforms, or communications.  This limitation of liability includes, but is not limited to, loss of profits, loss of data, loss of business or anticipated profits or savings, or disclosure of intellectual property.</p>\n\n<p>(c ) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, You agree that Conservation X Labs, its contractors, its coalition partners, and its Funders, as well as the directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers of each are responsible for any Loss arising out of, or in any way connected with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>delay or inability to access or use CXL Platform;</li>\n  <li>reliance on any Competition Information or other Content;</li>\n  <li>any unauthorized access to, modification or alteration of Content;</li>\n  <li>any Content sent or received or not sent or received;</li>\n  <li>any transaction entered into through this Website;</li>\n  <li>any infringement of rights, including disclosure of Intellectual Property Rights;</li>\n  <li>any threatening, defamatory, obscene, offensive, harmful, inappropriate or illegal Content or conduct of any party;</li>\n  <li>any Content sent by any third party using and/or included in this Website;</li>\n  <li>termination of Your participation; or,</li>\n  <li>any delays, interruptions, inaccuracies, errors, omissions or cessation of services.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>9.0 Dispute Resolution</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>9.1 Definition of Dispute:</strong> “Dispute” shall mean any claim, controversy and/or dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or the making, performance, breach, or interpretation of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any dispute relating to alleged tortious conduct, administrative decisions made by CXL in the operation of the Challenge and/or the decisions of any of the Review and Judging Panels.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.2 Governing Law:</strong> This Agreement and all Disputes arising hereunder shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, United States of America (“Laws”), without regard to its conflict of laws rules.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.3 CXL and Review and Judging Panels:</strong> Decisions made by CXL and/or the Review and Judging Panels: (i) are made in the sole and absolute discretion of CXL with the input of the Review and Judging Panels; (ii) are final; and (iii) are not subject to review, reconsideration, or contest.</p>\n\n<p>By choosing to participate in the Challenge and the associated prize, participants waive the right to challenge the outcome and agree to be bound by the determinations of the Prize judges and CXL, DAI, and USAID.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.4 Goal of the Challenge:</strong> Applicant and CXL agree that a paramount goal of the Challenge is to inspire and educate individuals, attracting new enthusiasm, new investments, and new ideas to the field and increase the connection that individuals around the world to support the goals of the Challenge (“Goals”).</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.5 Public Disputes Cause harm to the Challenge:</strong> Applicant and CXL agree that Applicant, CXL, Coalition, Funders and all of the affiliates have invested a substantial amount of time, effort, and resources in the Challenge. Applicant and CXL agree that, in light of the Challenge’s ultimate goal of inspiring and educating individuals, any public dispute regarding any claim or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement or the making, performance, breach, or interpretation of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any challenge to any decision by the Review and Judging Panels, would detract from the Goals defined in Section 9.4 above and would reflect poorly on Applicant, CXL, Coalition, Funders, and all of the affiliates of the Challenge. Further, any public dispute regarding any claim or controversy arising out of or related to this Agreement or the making, performance, breach, or interpretation of this Agreement, including, without limitation, any challenge to any decision by the Review and Judging Panels, will result in irreparable harm to CXL, Coalition, Funders, and all of the affiliates and prize fulfillment entities of the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.6 Resolution of Disputes pursuant to Agreement:</strong> \nAny and all Disputes shall be raised and handled solely pursuant to the dispute pursuant to\nresolution provisions set forth in this Agreement and in no other manner. Applicant and CXL agree that the mandatory and exclusive dispute resolution procedures in this Agreement are in the best interests of both Parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.7 Mediation:</strong>\nThese Participation Terms and Conditions and our relationship with You will be governed exclusively by laws in force in Washington, D.C., USA. Any litigation arising out of or relating to the Artisanal Mining Grand Challenge: the Amazon must be filed and pursued exclusively in the Courts of Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.), USA and you consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts. If either Party resorts to legal action relating to the participation, the prevailing party will be entitled to an award of all its costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees. Prior to filing any litigation claim, Parties both agree to seek mediation with a third party, not directly associated with the claim and selected by mutual agreement from the standing members of the review committee of the Challenge, in an effort to resolve any dispute.</p>\n\n<p>The Parties shall cooperate with one another in selecting a mediator and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. Each Party shall designate at least one (1) person with full settlement authority to attend an in-person mediation in Washington, District of Columbia, USA. The mediation must take place within thirty (30) days of a Party’s written request to engage in mediation, unless agreed otherwise in writing by the Parties.</p>\n\n<p>The Parties covenant that they shall participate in the mediation in good faith, and that they will share equally in the cost of the mediation, including mediator’s fees. Further, each Party shall pay all expenses for its own participation therein. All offers, promises, conduct, and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by either of the Parties, their agents, employees, experts, and attorneys, and by the mediator, shall be confidential, privileged under the laws of the District of Columbia, including Section § 16–4203, and inadmissible for any purpose, including, without limitation, impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the Parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable will not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8 Arbitration:</strong> \nIf the Parties are not able to settle the Dispute in mediation pursuant to Section 9.7 above, Applicant and CXL agree that: (i) any Dispute; (ii) any issues pertaining to the Dispute; and/or (iii) any claim that this Agreement or any part hereof is invalid, illegal, or otherwise voidable or void, shall be submitted to and finally determined by mandatory and binding arbitration. Arbitration will be conducted in two stages as set forth below. As a condition precedent to arbitration of any Dispute, the Party seeking to arbitrate the Dispute must file a demand for arbitration with JAMS in Washington DC, as set forth in Section 9.8.4, within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the date of service of the Notice of Dispute. Failure to file the demand to arbitrate with JAMS within such 180-day period shall mean that any right to arbitrate or litigate in any manner such Dispute shall be forever forfeited and waived.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8.1 Mandatory and Binding Arbitration</strong> – The arbitration and the Parties’ agreement therefore will be deemed to be self-executing, and if either Party fails to appear at any properly-noticed arbitration proceeding, an award may be entered against such Party despite said failure to appear and the matter will be dismissed with prejudice. Failure by either Party to pay the fees (or provide a required deposit) of the arbitrators and/or the arbitration administrator in accordance with the rules and policies of the applicable arbitration administrator will result in a forfeiture by the non-paying Party of the right to prosecute or defend the claim which is the subject of the arbitration, but will not otherwise serve to abate, stay, or suspend the arbitration proceedings. The Parties will share equally the arbitrators’ fees and expenses, administrative expenses, or other costs incurred in the arbitration; provided, however, that each party shall bear its own attorneys’ and experts’ fees and its own costs incurred in connection with any Dispute hereunder including the arbitration of any Dispute. Further, each Party shall compensate and pay all expenses for its employees and, with respect to Team, all other Team Members for their participation in the arbitration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8.2 Scope of Arbitrators’ Authority</strong> – The arbitrators will have no power or authority to grant attorneys’ fees, punitive or exemplary damages as part of their award. In no event may the provisions of this Agreement, or any ancillary agreement executed in connection with this Agreement, including, without limitation, amendments to this Agreement, be waived, modified, changed, or otherwise equitably excused by the arbitrators at any arbitration hearing. The Parties do not grant the arbitrators the powers of an amiable compositeur and the arbitrators do not have the power to decide ex aequo et bono. The arbitrators will apply Washington DC substantive Law to the proceeding. The arbitrators will not have the power to commit errors of Law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction for any such error. Any arbitration will be conducted in English in Washington D.C., USA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8.3 Jurisdiction for Entering Arbitration Awards</strong> – The award of the arbitrators will be the exclusive remedy between the Parties regarding any claims, causes of action, counterclaims, issues, or accountings presented or pleaded to the arbitrators. Any petition, motion, or request to vacate the award shall be filed exclusively in the Superior Court of the District of the Columbia, and the Parties expressly consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8.4 Stage 1 Arbitration</strong> – The first stage of arbitration shall be conducted before JAMS in Washington DC, in accordance with the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English. The matters to be considered and determined by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall include and be limited to the following:</p>\n\n<p>(i) First, the arbitrators shall determine whether or not the Party that served the Notice of Dispute strictly complied with the requirements set forth in Section 9.6 above. If the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute failed to strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, then the arbitrators shall issue an award dismissing the Dispute with prejudice and ruling that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute shall take nothing thereunder.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) Next, if (a) the arbitrators determine that the Party that served the Notice of Dispute did strictly comply with the requirements of Section 9.6 above, and (b) either Party asserts that the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall next determine whether or not the Dispute is subject to the Limitation of Liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above and issue a ruling of their findings. For purposes of this determination, the Parties agree and represent that the Limitation of Liability Clauses are not contrary to public policy.</p>\n\n<p>(iii) Each Party’s representation in this paragraph is a material inducement for the other party to enter into this agreement. If neither party asserts that the limitation of liability provisions set forth in Section 8.5 above are unenforceable in whole or in part, then the arbitrators shall issue a ruling that such provisions are fully enforceable with respect to the dispute.</p>\n\n<p>(iv) All awards, decisions and rulings made with regard to the items specified above by the arbitrators in Stage 1 Arbitration shall be binding upon both Parties and upon the arbitrators in 9.8.4 Stage 2 Arbitration (if applicable). However, except as required to establish the decisions and rulings of the arbitrators, the records of the proceedings in Stage 1 Arbitration shall not be admissible as evidence in Stage 2 Arbitration proceedings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8.5 Ninety (90)-Day Cooling Off Period</strong> – If the arbitrators have not dismissed the Dispute with prejudice when they issue their final rulings pursuant to Section 9.8.4 (i) above, then the Parties shall wait for a period of ninety (90) calendar days before proceeding with Stage 2 Arbitration, during which ninety (90)-day period, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve the Dispute. This period may be extended by mutual agreement of the Parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.8.6 Stage 2 Arbitration</strong> – If necessary, the second stage of arbitration shall be conducted before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Washington DC, in accordance with the then-prevailing Rules of Arbitration of the ICC by three (3) arbitrators appointed as follows: each Party shall select an arbitrator, and such arbitrators shall select a third; provided, however, that in all events at least two (2) out of the three (3) arbitrators must be active members of the bar of a U.S. State and that each arbitrator must be fluent in English. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the arbitrators used in Stage 1 Arbitration may be selected in Stage 2 Arbitration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9.9  Attorney’s Fees:</strong>\nUnless otherwise expressly set forth herein, the Parties shall bear their own attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the matters set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Confidentiality</strong></p>\n\n<p>10.1 “Confidential Information” Defined: Pursuant to this Agreement, each Party may provide the other, or its affiliates, certain information or material that is confidential to the disclosing Party. Such information or materials shall be marked as “Confidential” by the disclosing Party prior to disclosure.</p>\n\n<p>10.2 Exclusions from “Confidential Information”: Information or material will not be considered as confidential hereunder if it: (i) is public knowledge as of the Effective Date or subsequently becomes such through no breach of this Agreement; (ii) is rightfully in the receiving Party’s possession prior to the disclosing Party’s disclosure, as shown by written records; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to the receiving Party by a third party without restriction on its disclosure; (iv) is independently developed by or for the receiving Party without reliance upon Confidential Information received from the disclosing Party; and/or (v) is required to be disclosed by law.</p>\n\n<p>10.3 Obligation of Confidentiality: Each Party will: (i) hold the other Party’s Confidential Information in confidence (using at least the same measures as it does to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature) and not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party except to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement; and (ii) not remove or permit to be removed from any item any proprietary, confidential, or copyright notices, markings, or legends placed thereon by either Party. This obligation will continue in effect for five (5) years after expiration or termination of the Agreement.</p>\n\n<p>10.4 Applicant’s Entry and Submissions: Conservation X Labs acknowledges that information relating to technical aspects of any Entry developed by an Applicant and submitted to CXL’s platform or the Judging Panel as required by this Agreement, will be deemed Confidential Information of the Applicant, regardless of whether or not it is marked as such.</p>\n\n<p>10.5 Injunctive Relief: Each Party acknowledges that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section 11 above (Confidentiality), and such breach would result in irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, each Party, in addition to any other remedies that it may have, will be entitled, without the requirement of proving actual damages or posting a bond or other security (to the extent permitted under Law), to obtain equitable relief, including without limitation injunctive relief and specific performance in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n\n<p>10.6 Remedies: The remedies stated in Section 11.5 above are non-exclusive and the exercise of any right a Party may have will not preclude the exercise of any other right under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Media Rights Agreement</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>11.1   Unlimited License</strong></p>\n\n<p>CXL intends to capture audio, video, digital, and photographic material related to the Challenge (“CXL Media”). CXL shall retain (on behalf of itself, its Coalition, and Funders) the right to use Applicant’s name, likeness, image, and biographical information in any and all media for any purpose, including, without limitation, advertising and promotional purposes relating to the Competition and (b) releases CXL, its contractors, its coalition partners, and its Funders, as well as the directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, licensors, and suppliers of each, from any liability with respect thereto.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11.2  Right of Access</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Applicant shall give Conservation X Labs preferential (above Applicant media partners and other media organizations) access to any and all Applicant facilities or events for the purposes of the capture of CXL Media for later usage; these requests shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. Applicant shall use best efforts to provide similar access to facilities of Applicant contractors, Funders, or partners for the purposes of capture of CXL Media. If such access is not possible, such as for reasons of confidentiality or health and safety, Applicant shall provide a CXL with a written communication describing with particularity the reasons that such access is not possible. CXL shall consider such communication in good faith and will then determine whether or not (in its sole discretion) to waive this requirement with respect to the particular facility or event. The parties acknowledge and agree that Applicant’s agreement to provide such preferential access constitutes material consideration under this Agreement and CXL’s ability to capture and use CXL Media in communications to the general public is a primary purpose for which the Challenge is conducted. Accordingly, submission of bad faith requests or other abuse of this provision may, in the sole discretion of CXL, result in Applicant’s disqualification or other adverse consequences to Applicant.  Applicant agrees to execute all papers and to perform any acts as CXL may deem necessary to secure for CXL or its designee the rights herein assigned or granted, including, without limitation, any third-party consents that may be necessary to capture and use CXL Media. Further, Applicant irrevocably appoints CXL as Applicant’s attorney-in-fact to do all of the foregoing, such appointment being coupled with an interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11.2. No Limitation on License</strong></p>\n\n<p>CXL shall have the right to use, copy, sublicense, modify, transmit, display, distribute, perform, make, sell, assign, license, transfer, import, export, and otherwise dispose of or exploit CXL Media in any manner or medium whatsoever, existing now or in the future, including, without limitation, all motion picture rights of every kind, including, without limitation, theatrical and documentary motion picture rights, television motion picture rights, and home video rights, and all allied, subsidiary, and derivative rights, including, without limitation, sequel, prequel, and remake rights, novelization, comic book, comic strip, newspaper comics, “making of” book, merchandising rights, commercial tie-ups, stage rights, radio rights, webcast rights, internet display rights, and promotional and advertising rights, including, without limitation, the right to broadcast over radio, television, the internet, and all other media, advertisements with respect to any production produced based on the Challenge or the story of the Challenge. The right to capture and use CXL Media shall include, without limitation, all rights and title in and to any and all audio, video, or photographic material created by, or on the behalf of, CXL or its agent, representatives and assignees. CXL shall not receive any pecuniary consideration in exchange for the license or distribution of CXL Media. Except as necessary for purposes of judging the Challenge, CXL will not require Applicant to disclose their Craft in dissembled form or permit access to discussions with respect to pending patent applications or other Confidential Information of Applicant. Nevertheless, Applicant bears ultimate responsibility for ensuring that its Confidential Information is not revealed during the recording of any CXL Media.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11.3. Depiction of Intellectual Property</strong></p>\n\n<p>If CXL desires to depict any Applicant Intellectual Property not covered by the grants of rights herein in its production of CXL Media or for advertising or promotional purposes, CXL shall submit a request to Applicant for permission to use such materials solely for such purposes of producing media content or educational materials related to the Challenge. Applicant agrees not to unreasonably withhold, condition, or delay approval for CXL to depict Applicant Intellectual Property for production of CXL Media or educational materials related to the Challenge, it being understood that such approval would be withheld reasonably if it were to unduly interfere with Applicant’s revenue generation, efforts to file patent applications, agreements with financiers or customers, or trade secrets. Furthermore, Applicant agrees not to unreasonably withhold permission for advertising or promotional use related to the Challenge. Applicant shall use best efforts to respond to such requests within ten (10) business days. If the content of any CXL Media is subject to 17 U.S.C. 106A or any similar laws, Applicant hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert all rights under such laws and irrevocably appoints CXL as its agent to assert on Applicant’s behalf, Applicant’s moral rights or any equivalent rights regarding the form or extent of any alteration to the CXL Media (including, without limitation, removal or destruction) or the making of any derivative works based on the CXL Media, including, without limitation, photographs, drawings or other visual reproductions of the work, in any medium, for CXL’s purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11.4. Prior Review of Applicant Media Partners</strong></p>\n\n<p>CXL will use reasonable efforts to promote the Challenge. CXL also anticipates that Applicant may enter agreements with media partners that are interested in promoting Applicant’s participation in the Challenge (“Applicant Media Partners”). Applicant shall provide notice to CXL no later than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the execution of any agreement with an Applicant Media Partner, by submitting the following information to CXL: (i) name of Applicant Media Partner; (ii) a brief description of the media, marketing, or promotional rights granted to the Applicant Media Partner; and (iii) a written summary of the business points of any agreement with the Applicant Media Partner. CXL shall review such agreement terms within ten (10) business days. If such contracts or relationships involve any contractual or implicit commitment to exclusivity, then CXL may impose limitations on or reject the proposed Applicant Media Partner Agreement as CXL determines to be in the best interests of the Challenge. CXL may also reject the proposed Applicant Media Partner Agreement, if such agreement , in CXL’s sole opinion: (i) would cause Applicant to breach any term of this Agreement; (ii) would require unsuitable advertising including, but not limited to, any advertising that depicts, describes, implies, or promotes obscene or sexually explicit matters, libelous or illegal matters, violence, racial, sexual or other types of legally prohibited discrimination, a particular political view, or may infringe on or otherwise violate any rights of CXL or any third party; (iii) conflicts with the exclusivity of or jeopardizes any sponsorship associated with the Challenge; or (iv) undermines the Challenge, its underlying goals, or the mission of CXL. Team is encouraged to work with CXL well prior to finalizing any agreements with an Applicant Media Partner to streamline the approval process. If Applicant has signed agreements with Applicant Media Partners or other similar relationships prior to the execution of this Agreement, Applicant shall provide to CXL a detailed written summary of the business points of such agreements and shall amend or terminate such agreements upon request by CXL in accordance with this Exhibit.</p>\n",

The 10 Contests of the Solar Decathlon address building science, energy efficiency, occupant experience, community needs, affordability, resilience, and embodied environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>Collegiate teams that compete in the annual Design Challenge create residential or commercial building designs that will be evaluated on how well they meet the nation’s rapidly evolving demand for innovative, cost-effective, quick-to-build, high-quality, resilient, grid-interconnected, efficient buildings that respond to targeted community needs. The program is excited to offer six different divisions: New Housing, Retrofit Housing, Attached Housing, Multifamily Building, Office Building, and Education Building. Teams can start planning now for the Solar Decathlon 2022 Design Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>The 2022 Design Challenge adds a new building Division—Retrofit Housing—and has combined other Divisions to better focus on improving the current building stock. In the Retrofit Housing Division, teams modify an existing dwelling that consists of one or two units. Through renovation, the building will reach zero energy construction through upgrades to systems, such as plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and envelope. Partnerships with building owners are also encouraged to develop zero energy designs for real building projects across the country and around the world.</p>\n\n<p>Details about the Design Challenge are available on the <a href=\"https://www.solardecathlon.gov/2022/assets/pdfs/design-challenge-rules.pdf\">Solar Decathlon website</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>July 2021</strong> – Design Challenge Competition Team Application opens; Rules released</li>\n  <li><strong>September 26, 2021</strong> – Ready, Set, Solar Decathlon Event</li>\n  <li><strong>October 26, 2021</strong> – Design Challenge Team Application due</li>\n  <li><strong>September 2021 to March 2022</strong> – Webinars and Building Science Education offered</li>\n  <li><strong>February 2022</strong> – All teams complete Project Proposal and finalize Division selection</li>\n  <li><strong>April 2022</strong> – Design Challenge Finalist Teams complete their project submissions and present to industry leaders.</li>\n</ul>\n",

The 10 Contests of the Solar Decathlon address building science, energy efficiency, occupant experience, community needs, affordability, resilience, and embodied environmental impact.</p>\n\n<p>Teams competing in the Solar Decathlon Build Challenge work during a two-year period to design, build, and operate their houses in their own region. The <a href=\"https://www.solardecathlon.gov/event/challenges-build.html\">2023 Build Challenge</a> consists of a design and construction phase. First, the teams design their homes through April 2022. The top 20 teams who are approved to proceed will complete construction activities through April 2023 with the support of $50,000 of prize funding.</p>\n\n<p>During the Competition Event, teams will be evaluated on how well they meet the nation’s rapidly evolving demand for new and retrofit homes that are innovative, cost-effective, net zero energy, resilient, grid-interconnected, and efficient that respond to targeted community needs. \nEach home will be evaluated based on 10 Contests, some juried and some measured locally on the building site. Partnerships with building owners are also encouraged to develop energy-positive designs for real building projects across the country and around the world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>July 2021</strong> – Build Challenge Competition Team Application opens; Rules released</li>\n  <li><strong>September 26, 2021</strong> – Ready, Set, Solar Decathlon Event (Virtual)</li>\n  <li><strong>October 26, 2021</strong> – Build Challenge Team Application due; All teams with a complete Team Application are accepted to participate</li>\n  <li><strong>Fall 2021 to Spring 2022</strong> – Webinars and Building Science Education offered</li>\n  <li><strong>April 2022</strong> – Build Challenge teams present their designs to a panel of industry experts to determine who will receive prize funding and an approval-to-proceed to the construction phase</li>\n  <li><strong>Spring 2023</strong> – Solar Decathlon Community Exhibitions, during which competing teams exhibit their as-built houses to their local communities, offering tours of the house, hosting educational activities, and verifying functionality as part of the measured contest activities</li>\n  <li><strong>April 2023</strong> – Solar Decathlon Competition Event with teams presenting to juries; Winners announced</li>\n</ul>\n",

Some of these patients develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a life-threatening inflammation of organs and tissues. Methods to distinguish children at risk for severe COVID-19 complications, including conditions such as MIS-C are needed for earlier interventions to improve pediatric patient outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Multiple HHS divisions are coming together for a data challenge competition that will leverage de-identified electronic health record data to develop, train and validate computational models that can predict severe COVID-19 complications in children, equipping healthcare providers with the information and tools they need to identify pediatric patients at risk.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge  is sponsored by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, in partnership with two institutes from the National Institutes of Health – the National Institute of Health’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) – along with the Health Resources and Services Administration’s (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The challenge will be administered by Sage Bionetworks.</p>\n\n<p>Challenge participants will be asked to develop, train, and validate computational models to predict pediatric patients at risk for hospitalization, need for ventilation, and cardiovascular interventions, utilizing de-identified electronic health record data available through NCATS’ National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) Data Enclave. The N3C Data Enclave is a central, harmonized data repository that represents electronic health records from over 55 health centers across the U.S. To protect patient privacy, de-identified data provides information useful to researchers without revealing any information that could identify individual patients.</p>\n\n<p>BARDA is part of the office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Aug. 19</strong> - Onboarding Phase</li>\n  <li><strong>Sep. 15</strong> - Round 1 Begins</li>\n  <li><strong>Oct. 12</strong> - Round 2 Begins</li>\n  <li><strong>Nov. 19</strong> - End Round 1 &amp; 2</li>\n  <li><strong>TBD</strong> - Winners Announced</li>\n  <li><strong>TBD</strong> - Collaboration Phase Begins</li>\n</ul>\n",

Those trained models will then be tested on a holdout set to establish initial model performance. Models will then be put through a “final training”. The primary metrics used to score models will be the Fβ metric, followed by the Area Under the Precision Recall Curve and the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve. The AUROC will be used to evaluate model generalizability, where models will be evaluated for temporal, cross-site, and demographic generalizability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Qualitative Metrics</strong></p>\n\n<p>Qualitative metrics of utility and reproducibility will also be used as part of the final ranking of the submissions. Factors related to model utility include (1) feature interpretation (Can the factors driving individual predictions be understood or is the model a black box?), (2) method clarity (Are the code, documentation, and final submission write up understandable and clear?), (3) timeliness of predictions (are models able to make accurate predictions before an intervention needs to happen), and (4) context utility (can a model still make accurate predictions in the setting in which it will be used?). Factors related to reproducibility include (1) technical reproducibility (Can the code be deployed and re-run successfully under different computational conditions?), (2) prediction reproducibility (Does the model make the same predictions each time under the same conditions?), and (3) documentation reproducibility (Is there sufficient documentation to replicate the model?).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Judging Criteria</strong></p>\n\n<p>The above metrics will become part of a ranking consensus for the submissions in each of the challenge questions. The primary purpose of this challenge is to identify the most clinically useful predictions models for pediatric severity of COVID-19. The judges will use both the quantitative metrics and the qualitative metrics to identify the models submitted to each question that are most likely to be clinically useful.</p>\n\n<p>For more information: <a href=\"https://www.synapse.org/peds_covid_severity\">https://www.synapse.org/peds_covid_severity</a></p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the annual “$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas in the area of Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) that are intended to be the foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that the Challenge will enable the winners to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA biomedical entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Subject of the Challenge</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its success and popularity within the community. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas in the Substance Use Disorder (SUD) research area that are purposefully intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful biomedical startups. NIDA offers $100,000 conjointly with technical mentoring from NIDA biomedical entrepreneurship experts. NIDA expects that the prize competition will inspire and enable the winners to test the premise that their SUD research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide prize money and dedicated biomedical entrepreneurial assistance to the “would be” startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g., small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that the newly created startups will eventually contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>\n\n<p>What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adopted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea would only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating a startup around their research idea with the goal of creating the startup product for the target customers. Here, the term “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific field into the SUD area, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to a previously underserved customer.</p>\n\n<p>The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively, and willingness to be coached to push forward under conditions of business uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide technical assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Key Dates</em></strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Launch: August 19, 2021</li>\n  <li>Submission Start: August 30, 2021 9:00 AM ET</li>\n  <li>Submission End: November 16, 2021 11:59 PM ET</li>\n  <li>Judging Period: November 29, 2021 to December 10, 2021</li>\n  <li>Winners Announced: December 17, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong><em>Statutory Authority to Conduct the Challenge</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>NIDA is conducting this Challenge under the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization Act of 2010, as amended [15 U.S.C. § 3719]. The general purpose of NIDA is to conduct and support biomedical and behavioral research, health-services research, research training, and health information dissemination with respect to the prevention of drug abuse and the treatment of drug abusers. This Challenge is consistent with and advances the mission of NIDA as described in 42 U.S.C. 285o in that it supports biotech startups in the development of research ideas that would further an understanding and management of SUD. As this Challenge is consistent with and advances the mission of NIDA in that it seeks to identify novel strategies to combat drug addiction, any submissions pursuing ideas in the areas of alcohol use disorder and pain will not be accepted.</p>\n",

The score for each submission will be the sum of the scores from each of the voting judges. The scores will be listed in order, from highest to lowest. Challenge contenders with sufficiently high scores will then be contacted via tele- or videoconference. Those meetings will be used to gather more details about the information provided in the Submission Package and to determine the up-to-date level of participants’ availability, interest, and commitment. Final prize recommendations will be determined based on the judges’ scoring and tele- or videoconference meetings.</p>\n",
            "how-to-enter": "<p>Participants must be a group of individuals (i.e., a team assembled with the purpose of participating in this Challenge). Each team is required to identify a team leader who registers and submits a required Submission Package on behalf of the team. The team leader must send the completed registration form and all submission materials to <a href=\"mailto:NIDAChallenge@nih.gov\">NIDAChallenge@nih.gov</a> with the subject line “<strong>Start a SUD Startup Submission Package</strong>” by the specified submission deadline date and time. You can <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/sites/default/files/2021_Start_SUD_Startup_Registration_Form.docx\">download the registration form here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Submission Requirements</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Each submission for this Challenge requires a complete Submission Package. The Submission Package includes the registration form, a 4-page written proposal describing the idea, and a 5-minute video introducing the team (see requirements below for the proposal and video). Both the idea and the 5-minute video will be evaluated. Submissions that do not follow the format described below will be disqualified and removed from the prize considerations.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Proposal.</strong> The proposal must consist of a PDF file with at least 1-inch margins and be no more than four (4) pages long. Font size must be no smaller than 11-point Arial. All submissions must be in English.

The research idea must be defensible and evidence based. (1 page)</li>\n      <li><strong>Team Technical Competence and Research Experience.</strong> Convince the Challenge judges of your technical competence. Be brief, persuasive, and only present the relevant information. Do not use the NIH Bibliographic Sketch format. (0.5 page)</li>\n      <li><strong>Prototype Description and Step-by-Step Use of Final Product, as Envisioned.</strong> Describe, in as many details as possible, what the prototype of your envisioned product would look like. Then, walk the Challenge judges through the typical use of the product, using simple terms and instructions. (1.5 pages)</li>\n      <li><strong>Need Validation.</strong> Explain the methods you will use (how, when, where, whom) to determine whether the product is needed by the target customer and whether that end user/customer would be willing to pay for the product. (1 page)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Video.</strong> A brief 5-minute video must be posted to YouTube and the link to the video provided. In contrast to the proposal, the video is intended to introduce the team, not the research idea. The team and its people are the most important evaluation criteria for entrepreneurial success.</p>\n\n    <p><strong><em>In the YouTube video:</em></strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hacker,” also known as technical lead, with the skills to develop your product and to focus on the available technology options and requirements.</li>\n      <li>In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hipster,” also known as the end user/customer need lead, the person concerned with the customer experience and design. This team member understands the end-user of your product and focuses on the medical and healthcare delivery issues (most often, a practicing SUD physician, clinical department manager, etc.).</li>\n      <li>In one minute or less, tell NIDA who on your team is the lead “hustler,” also known as the business or entrepreneurial lead, with the skills or aspirations to focus on the overall business objectives, customer definition, business plan, etc.</li>\n      <li>Tell NIDA how long you have known each other and relay something that can illustrate the drive or the desire of each team member to become a startup founder.</li>\n      <li>What unique skill set, background, or experience does this team have that has led them to pursue this idea?</li>\n      <li>Tell NIDA something about each team member that demonstrates a high level of perseverance and grit.</li>\n      <li>Tell NIDA about a time when your great idea was rejected.

In addition, law enforcement personnel often encounter individuals in situations when the confirmation of the persons’ identity or a background check is necessary. If the individual does not have proper identification or is possibly using a false identity, officers can capture fingerprint images and compare the images to national, state, or local identity databases to help determine the individual’s identity. This information can help the officer make a better decision on whether to release the individual or hold them for further processing.</p>\n\n<p>In a typical situation where a law enforcement officer needs to run a full identification check with fingerprint search, the law enforcement officer would possibly need to transport the individual to a facility for processing. Fingerprint images are critical because fingerprint data can be extremely helpful in the proper identification of an individual. However, shortages in personnel and equipment resources, as well as health and environmental factors, limit the ability of law enforcement to process and transport individuals to fingerprinting facilities.</p>\n\n<p>Developing or improving fingerprint capture solutions that are more convenient and cost effective for use by field officers would minimize the financial and logistical burden on public safety organizations while ensuring officers have access to relevant identification databases. This prize challenge aims to create or improve an application on a mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet, that accesses the device sensors and captures and processes high-quality digital fingerprint images that are interoperable with existing fingerprint management systems. Solutions may use contactless, contact-based, or a combination of technologies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Goals and Objectives</strong></p>\n\n<p>This challenge seeks innovative new or improved mobile applications that access the available sensors on mobile devices to capture high-quality digital fingerprint images, thereby improving the performance and efficiency of identification in the field. Contestants are asked to submit a mobile application that captures quality digital images of at least two fingers (including index and middle) on the left and right hands. Contestants are encouraged to bridge technology gaps identified in the Official Rules and to innovate in any area that would improve the accuracy and quality of results. The ultimate objective of this challenge is to advance technology while preserving the form factor of the mobile device. Law enforcement officers explicitly do not want to carry additional equipment; however, a contestant’s prototype may modify the form factor with justification.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Protecting the public from heat-related illness and death during extreme heat events or in connection with other disasters is an important part of disaster preparedness and resilience and the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) mission. This Challenge is seeking innovative climate-friendly cooling solutions that can provide access to cooling to people in public and residential areas. DHS is looking for novel ways to protect those at risk of heat-related illness or death, including first responders, households or group quarters without access to conventional cooling systems or experiencing sustained power outages, and displaced or homeless populations. Relative to current cooling solutions, these new designs will be more eco-friendly and energy efficient, while being cost effective, scalable, durable, and allowing for alternate power sources. These features will make them well suited for mitigating emerging risks associated with extreme heat conditions from or during disasters. Cascading impacts resulting from catastrophic damages or loss of power during disasters exacerbate risks of heat-related illness, when conventional air conditioning (A/C) is not available during extreme heat conditions. Climate change is also driving local heat events that exceed historic temperature extremes. During heat events, those at the greatest risk of heat-related illness include infants and young children; people 65 years of age or older; people with illnesses or chronic health conditions; and homeless or displaced populations. First responders or those required to work outdoors in support of community lifelines are also at risk for heat-related illness or require solutions to support encounters with heat-related illness.</p>\n\n<p>This Challenge is part of the DHS’s effort to implement a proactive approach to climate change adaptation and resilience. This will be the first in a series of Challenges to address hazards posed by extreme weather due to climate change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>\n\n<p>Promoting national resilience against the many threats associated with climate change, including extreme heat, is a DHS priority.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-heat-related-deaths\"> extreme heat events have become more common across the United States</a> in recent decades and are expected to become more common, more severe, and longer lasting as global temperatures continue to rise.</p>\n\n<p>Extreme heat events and their effects significantly impact the United States. Extreme heat events are one of the leading causes of <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/trackingheat/index.html\">weather-related deaths</a> in the United States, and a reason for many emergency departments visits and hospital stays.  For example, record-breaking heat indexes in the Pacific Northwest in June 2021 caused more than <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7029e1.htm?s_cid=mm7029e1_w\">2,500 people to seek emergency department treatment for heat-related illness</a>.  In addition to causing extreme heat events, rising global temperatures produce extreme weather conducive to wildfires, flooding, and hurricanes, and that extreme weather can have large cascading effects of extended power outages coupled with high temperatures. This is causing large populations in communities across the country to be more vulnerable to heat-related illness. In the wake of the extended power outages caused by Hurricane Ida, for example, <a href=\"https://weather.com/news/news/2021-09-09-heat-hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-power-outages\">Louisiana has recorded several heat-related deaths</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are some simple <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/features/trackingheat/index.html\">safety measures</a> that people can take to protect themselves from heat-related illnesses or death, including avoiding unnecessary sun exposure, avoiding unnecessary hard work or activities outdoors, drinking water often, wearing light and loose-fitting clothing, and staying in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day.  However, many Americans who experience extreme heat events lack access to conventional air conditioning.  Solutions are needed to protect them, and to do so in an energy-efficient, user-friendly, and cost-effective way.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The FAA is developing a vision for an info-centric National Airspace System (NAS) for 2035. Full connectivity will come from infrastructure supporting NAS operations that enable all systems to share data. With all types of devices connected to the Internet (known as the Internet of Things [IoT]) and advances in wireless technology, nearly everything can be connected from nearly any location at any time. This ubiquitous system-to-system communication can be used to share location and intent information across vehicles, subsystems, and Air Traffic Management (ATM) stakeholders from airspace users to airports. Through improved filtering and presentation methods, this information and automation-based digital assistance will support human situational awareness. Autonomous systems can rely on this information, in concert with FAA-approved operating rules, to safely operate in the airspace.</p>\n\n<p>As technology advances, information systems will operate with a level of information assurance well beyond today’s levels. Advances in cybersecurity will assure information integrity between end systems across diverse infrastructure. Network diversity will help ensure reliability, continuity of operations, and sustainment of the advertised level of service. Cloud technologies (e.g., software-defined networking and network function virtualization) will enable dynamic configuration of applications and information resources to meet real-time demands of users and service suppliers. Armed with large amounts of collected, shared, and stored operational data (e.g., on flight paths, position, velocity, weather, infrastructure status, and airspace), systems will be able to construct actionable real-time recommendations, and increasing flight efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Through the Smart Connected Aviation Student Competition, FAA seeks innovative ideas from the academic community that take advantage of a future info-centric NAS (including connected aircraft) that will benefit NAS users in the following four (4) categories:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Category 1: Commercial Air Transportation</li>\n  <li>Category 2: General Aviation</li>\n  <li>Category 3: Emerging Operations</li>\n  <li>Category 4: Traveling Public</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Teams should address one (1) of the four (4) categories. Descriptions of the user categories and potential submission topics are provided below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 1: Commercial Air Transportation</strong></p>\n\n<p>Commercial air transportation is defined as “transportation by air of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire.” This also includes airport ground operations, take-off, in-flight and landing. Technologies and systems that minimize ground wait times and reduce flight times through avoidance of weather and coordination with other connected aircraft are of interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 2: General Aviation</strong></p>\n\n<p>General Aviation (GA)” is defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as “all civil aviation operations other than scheduled air services and non-scheduled air transport operations for remuneration or hire”. It includes recreational flying, pilot training, business aviation, agriculture applications, emergency medical services, law enforcement and firefighting, aerial photography and survey work, and sightseeing and air tours. GA typically use a separate general aviation terminal at an airport and are looking for many of the same benefits as the commercial/business traveler, but they would have specialized needs arising out of the classification of service listed above. Many are also pilots and would have interest in apps, technologies and systems that would make cockpit and air operations safer and more efficient.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 3: Emerging Operations</strong></p>\n\n<p>Emerging aviation systems and users would include, but are not limited to, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing (eVTOL) systems, Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs), as well as commercial space. Autonomous UAS will soon be ubiquitous and will have major on-going operations in package delivery, agriculture, surveying, law enforcement, security, etc. Approaches for safe integration of these systems into the NAS are of interest. Over 100 companies are currently developing electric air taxis to transport small numbers of passengers over short distances, primarily in urban areas. These systems are expected to evolve into integrated regional air mobility systems. Eventually most or all operations are expected to be autonomous. These systems would primarily operate out of new “vertiports” as well as existing airports. Smart connected aircraft technologies are essential for these systems to operate safely and efficiently. Companies are also developing PAVs that will enable individuals to travel almost anywhere from point-to-point rapidly. Technologies and systems to enable these operations, including “detect and avoid” systems, are also of interest. One of FAA’s major roles is to “efficiently integrate Commercial Space operations into the NAS to minimize impact on air travel and maximize safety.” Technologies and concepts to enable these systems to safely operate in the NAS are of interest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 4: Traveling Public</strong></p>\n\n<p>Commercial and business travelers travel nationally and internationally on scheduled commercial flights on large and regional aircraft that carry 20 to 500 passengers. In the future, they will also be traveling regionally on AAM and eVTOL systems. They are interested in getting from airport departure to airport arrival in a safe, convenient, comfortable, low-cost, and entertaining manner. This begins at airport departure and parking, through check-in, baggage pick-up, passing security, transport to/from the gate, and boarding/deplaning of the aircraft. Smart airport technologies that take advantage of IoT would be of interest. An additional area of interest may include inflight cabin activities e.g., systems that provide in-flight information and entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>Please Note: Submissions for all categories must incorporate solutions that ensure that diverse passenger populations (e.g., people with disabilities, seniors, children, international visitors) are able to benefit from the emerging technology.</p>\n\n<p>Submissions can include apps, technologies, business plans, subsystem designs, system designs, etc. Submissions should include a five (5) page paper with sufficient detail, diagrams, and references to provide a thorough explanation of how the concept would work and provide tangible benefits (described in the paper) to one of the four categories (1) Commercial Air Transportation, (2) General Aviation, (3) Emerging Operations or (4) Traveling Public. All submissions are due by January 20, 2022. A finalist will be selected in each of the categories and will present to a panel of judges at a technical symposium in Atlantic City, New Jersey in late June of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Please carefully review the FAA Challenge website <a href=\"https://faachallenge.nianet.org/\">https://faachallenge.nianet.org</a> for updated competition details. Details for the FAA Challenge are subject to change. Teams who submit an Expression of Interest by the deadline will be notified of any and all changes, which will also be made available on the FAA Challenge FAQs website under a “Changes” section heading.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p>Submissions: The FAA Challenge competition will begin and submissions will be accepted between 12:00 AM September 30, 2021 and 11:59 PM ET January 20, 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Expression of Interest: Teams are encouraged to submit an Expression of Interest to compete in this FAA Challenge by 11:59 PM ET October 15, 2021.</p>\n\n<p>Finalist Announcement: A panel of FAA judges will conduct an evaluation and select four finalist teams.

            "description": "<p><strong>We are seeking bold innovations to save lives and reduce Veteran suicide by at least 10%.</strong> Recognizing that there are other entities, including but not limited to academia, industry, nonprofits, other government agencies, community partners, and Veteran-service organizations, engaged in both identifying innovation solutions as well as being direct service providers, the VA Suicide Prevention Grand Challenge (VA SPGC) serves as a pipeline to rapidly source suicide prevention innovations from non-VA entities (<a href=\"https://blogs.va.gov/VAntage/94100/report-links-substance-use-suicide-veterans-offers-support/\">Report links substance use and suicide among Veterans, offers support, Vantage Point</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Objective</strong></p>\n\n<p>The following are potential areas, among several, that VA SPGC may explore:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Digital Life Data &amp; Early Warning Systems</strong>—Innovators are sought who can develop scalable and interoperable suicide risk prevention analytics that are ethical and clinically valid in an effort to enhance real-time prevention and responsive interventions that are local and accessible for Veterans in VHA care as well as Veterans outside of VHA care and in crisis.</li>\n  <li><strong>Improved Access to Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) Services</strong>— As VCL faces the opportunities that <a href=\"https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-365165A1.pdf\">988 adoption</a> will bring to our mission of providing world class crisis care to Veterans, we are looking for innovative solutions that can improve efficiency and quality during expected increase in volume. Innovators are sought who can leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing to better understand patterns, unknown signals, and unexpected relationships. This objective will also incorporate process flow innovations that use technology and non-technology solutions for crisis line staffing and operational improvements.</li>\n  <li><strong>Firearm suicide prevention and lethal means safety</strong>— In 2019 the majority of firearm deaths in the United States (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html\">Firearm Violence Prevention, Violence Prevention Injury Center, CDC</a>) were suicides and among Veterans, nearly 70% of suicide deaths in 2019 were by firearm (<a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2021/2021-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-9-8-21.pdf\">2021 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (va.gov)</a>). We will seek innovative solutions to prevent firearm suicide.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Solution Framework</strong></p>\n\n<p>Following are additional parameters for consideration in developing innovations:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Target Community</strong>—Innovations shall meet the needs of service members transitioning out of the military, Veterans enrolled in VA healthcare or receiving VA benefits and Veterans not enrolled in VA healthcare or benefits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Prevention/Intervention Implementation Timing</strong>—The prevention/intervention innovation can provide solutions addressing immediate impact (Now); near-term impact (Next) or long-term impact (Later) efforts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Health Equity</strong>—Innovations should account for specific subpopulations such as women Veterans, new Veterans (those who are planning to transition or have transitioned in the last 1-3 years), Veterans ages 55 and over, Veterans ages 18-34, and American Indian, Alaska Native, Black, African American Veterans, Asian American, Latin or Hispanic Veterans and LGBTQ+ Veterans.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Suicide remains a national public health concern—45,861 American adults died from suicide in 2019, including 6,261 U.S. Veterans. While suicide can affect all Americans, it has been shown to have a disproportionate impact on the Veteran community. Hope serves as a key and necessary anchor to strengthen Veterans amidst numerous life circumstances. In a similar manner, hope must imbue the overall suicide prevention mission, anchoring it amidst mission challenges and circumstances. The 2021 <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2021/2021-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-9-8-21.pdf\">National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report (va.gov)</a> provides the most comprehensive analysis of Veteran suicide data. Regarding lethal means involved in suicide deaths among Veterans, firearms accounted for 70.2% of male Veteran suicides in 2019 (up from 69.6% in 2018) and 49.8% of female Veteran suicides in 2019 (up from 41.1% in 2018). The proportion of firearm-related Veteran suicide deaths increased in 2019 compared to 2001.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p>Launch January 31, 2022 and additional key dates are forthcoming.</p>\n",

Contestants and potential winners may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Publicity</strong></p>\n\n<p>The winners of these prizes (collectively, “Winners”) will be featured on the VA website, newsletters, social media, and other outreach materials. \nExcept where prohibited, participation in the VA SPGC constitutes each winner’s consent to VA, its agents’, and any VA SPGC co-sponsors’ use of each winner’s name, likeness, photograph, voice, opinions, and/or hometown and state information for promotional purposes through any form of media, worldwide, without further permission, payment or consideration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Payments</strong></p>\n\n<p>The prize Challenge winners will be paid prizes directly from VA. Prior to payment, winners will be required to verify eligibility. The verification process with the agency includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. \nAll cash prizes awarded to contestants by VA are subject to tax liabilities, and no withholding will be assessed by VA on behalf of the contestant claiming a cash prize.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Liability and Insurance</strong></p>\n\n<p>By participating in the VA SPGC, you agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless, the Sponsor and/or the Administrator and their respective affiliates, subsidiaries, advertising and promotions agencies, and each of their respective agents, representatives, officers, directors, shareholders, and employees (collectively, “Sponsor Entities” and/or “Administrator Entities”) from and against any injuries, losses, damages, claims, actions and any liability of any kind (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from or arising out of your participation in, association with, or submission to the VA SPGC (including any claims alleging that your entry infringes, misappropriates, or violates any third party’s patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property or proprietary rights). The Sponsor and/or the Administrator are not responsible for any technical failures related to communication or submission failures, such as unavailable networks or server connections; other failures related to hardware, software, viruses, or incomplete, late, or misdirected entries. Any compromise to the fair, proper and legal conduct of the VA SPGC may result in the disqualification of an entry, the termination of the Challenge, or other remedial or legal action at the sole discretion of the Sponsor and/or the Administrator.

            "description": "\n<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is seeking innovative ways to address the impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) on Black or African American Women through the <em>HHS Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDC) Innovator Award Competition: Innovative Methods to Address the Impact of Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals on Black or African American Women.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Background/Issue</strong></p>\n\n<p>The HHS OWH is charged with providing expert advice and consultation to the Secretary on scientific, legal, ethical, and policy issues relating to women’s health.  OWH establishes short- and long-term goals within the Department and coordinates on activities within the Department that relate to disease prevention, health promotion, service delivery, research, and public and health care professional education for issues of particular concern to women throughout their lifespan.  OWH also leads the Coordinating Committee on Women’s Health.  Additionally, OWH is responsible for facilitating the exchange of information through the National Women’s Health Information Center.  Addressing inequities in women’s health is a focus area for OWH.</p>\n\n<p>Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are substances in the environment, food, and consumer products (metals, many industrial chemicals, natural and synthetic hormones, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, pharmaceutical drugs, plastics/plasticizers, and fuels)  that interfere with hormone biosynthesis, metabolism, or action resulting in a deviation from normal homeostatic control or reproduction.<sup>1</sup> Some of the major known EDCs found in water include disinfection byproducts, fluorinated substances, bisphenols (chemicals used in plastics, epoxy resins, and thermal paper), phthalates (chemicals used in plastics/plasticizers), pesticides, and natural and synthetic estrogens.  Exposure to these compounds is associated with adverse health and reproductive outcomes in non-human animals and humans; thus, the presence of these chemicals in water has become a public health concern.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>There are significant health disparities among women impacted by EDCs.<sup>3</sup> Research has shown that non-Hispanic Blacks have higher serum and/or urinary EDC concentrations compared to non-Hispanic Whites. <sup>4</sup>  Additionally, Black or African Americans were noted to have higher exposures to diabetogenic EDCs, including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, multiple chemical constituents of air pollution, bisphenol A, and phthalates.<sup>5</sup> One study evaluated hair products used by Black women and noted multiple chemicals associated with endocrine disruption and asthma.<sup>6</sup> Additionally, studies link environmental estrogen and EDC exposure through personal care products to breast cancer risk in Black or African Americans.<sup>7</sup> Furthermore, pregnant non-Hispanic Black or African American women have higher concentrations of phthalates and parabens.<sup>8</sup></p>\n\n<p>Many racial and ethnic disparities in health can be traced to the cumulative effect of higher levels of exposure in racial/ethnic minorities, in combination with disparities in the availability of resources considered to be protective factors, such as green spaces or healthy food options.<sup>9</sup> OWH is committed to advancing health equity by addressing gaps in knowledge of EDC risks and providing solutions to reduce EDC exposure risks on Black or African American women.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong>\nOWH is creating a national competition to identify innovative programs that address gaps in knowledge and provide solutions to reduce EDC exposure risk for people at risk of EDC exposure where the programs could be or are already applied to Black or African American women.   The goal of this competition is to identify and fund programs that demonstrate effectiveness, sustainability, and the ability to replicate and/or expand interventions that address gaps in knowledge and provide solutions to reduce EDC exposure risk for Black or African American women.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</strong></p>\n\n<p>The program must demonstrate evidence-based interventions to target knowledge gaps in understanding the risks associated with EDCs and offer populations served effective resources on how to mitigate their EDC exposure risks. The program will be shared with the general public, including through informational webinars, websites, social media, and listservs.</p>\n\n<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Identification of innovative programs</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period start: September 30, 2021</li>\n  <li>Webinar: October 15, 2021 and October 20, 2021</li>\n  <li>Submission period end: November 15, 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Awarding programs with demonstrated effectiveness</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period start: September 30, 2022</li>\n  <li>Submission period end: October 15, 2022</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Awarding the programs that have successfully replicated and/or expanded</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period start: September 30, 2023</li>\n  <li>Submission period end:  October 15, 2023</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup>Evanthia Diamanti-Kandarakis, Jean-Pierre Bourguignon, Linda C.

            "description": "<p>The Office on Women’s Health (OWH) in partnership with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is seeking innovative ways to improve postpartum care for Black or African American  and American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) low-income beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).  We are pleased to announce the <strong>HHS Postpartum Equity in Care Challenge: Innovative Methods to Improve Postpartum Care for Black or African American and American Indian/ Alaska Native Women</strong>, with an emphasis on follow-up care for conditions associated with morbidity and mortality in the later postpartum period, including diabetes, postpartum depression and/or postpartum anxiety, hypertension, and substance use disorders (SUD).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background/Issue:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Medicaid covers 42 percent of all births overall with two-thirds of births to Black or African American and AI/AN women. In addition, there are significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related deaths—which are three to four times more common among Black or African American and AI/AN women than among White women.<sup>1</sup> More than one-half of pregnancy-related mortality occurs in the 12-month postpartum period and about one-third occurs between 7 and 365 days post-delivery.<sup>2</sup> Postpartum care is a critical opportunity to address and provide follow up for conditions associated with morbidity and mortality in the postpartum period. Yet, there are many disparities in postpartum care. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Black or African American women have the highest risk for progression from gestational diabetes to chronic diabetes, yet have lower rates of diabetes postpartum screening.<sup>3</sup></li>\n  <li>Approximately 13 percent of postpartum women experience depression, with higher self-reported rates among women of color.<sup>4</sup></li>\n  <li>Black or African American women ages 20-44 years have more than twice the hypertension prevalence of other racial and ethnic groups.<sup>5</sup></li>\n  <li>Several state Medicaid and CHIP agencies have identified disparities in access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment among postpartum beneficiaries.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The goal of this competition is to identify effective programs that can address equity of postpartum care for Black or African American and AI/AN beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 1 of the competition aims to identify effective programs that range in their design and range geographically. The goal of Phase 1 will be the identification of effective programs that can successfully increase access to, attendance at, and quality of care for postpartum visits for Black or African American and AI/AN beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 2 builds upon the work of Phase 1. Part of the scoring criteria for Phase 2 evaluates whether the program was successfully replicated and/or expanded. Participants are expected to successfully replicate and/or expand the program: (1) in another geographic area or a wider geographic area; (2) in another clinical setting; and/or (3) by increasing the size and/or reach of the program.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Identification of successful programs</p>\n\n<p><strong>Submission period begins:</strong> September 30, 2021, 8:00 a.m. EST.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Submission deadline:</strong> Phase 1 submissions are due by December 17, 2021, 5:00 p.m. EST.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Awarding programs that have successfully replicated and/or expanded.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Submission period begins:</strong> September 16, 2022.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Submission deadline:</strong> December 16, 2022, 5:00 p.m. EST.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/disparities-pregnancy-related-deaths/infographic.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/disparities-pregnancy-related-deaths/infographic.html</a>; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm#race-ethnicity\">https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm#race-ethnicity</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup><a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/downloads/mih-expert-workgroup-recommendations.pdf\">https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/downloads/mih-expert-workgroup-recommendations.pdf</a>, pg. 12; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/maternal-deaths/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/maternal-deaths/index.html</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup><a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/downloads/mih-expert-workgroup-recommendations.pdf\">https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/downloads/mih-expert-workgroup-recommendations.pdf</a>, pg. 15</p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup><a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/downloads/mih-beneficiary-profile.pdf\">https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/quality-of-care/downloads/mih-beneficiary-profile.pdf</a> (Slide 64);  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919a2.htm?s_cid=mm6919a2_w\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919a2.htm?s_cid=mm6919a2_w</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup>Azeez O, Kulkarni A, Kuklina EV, Kim SY, Cox S.
