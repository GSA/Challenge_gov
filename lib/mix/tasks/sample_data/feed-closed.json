Up to $425,000 will be awarded to winning teams that create haptic interface prototypes that could improve public safety operations.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Public safety officials perform tasks in a variety of environments that severely limit their senses and ability to communicate. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This </span><span lang=\"EN\">challenge seeks to investigate the relevance of haptic interfaces assisting in first responder tasks</span><span lang=\"EN\">, such as monitoring patient vitals, navigating complex spaces with limited visibility, or maintaining situational awareness. </span><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task.</span><span lang=\"EN\"> Contestants will also have the opportunity to demo their initial prototypes with first responders at <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/2019-public-safety-broadband-stakeholder-meeting\">the 2019 Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Meeting</a> in Chicago, IL.PSCR will assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and level of user satisfaction of the haptic interface prototypes and their ability to assist first responders in conducting their tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge launches March 18, 2019, and concept paper submissions are due April 22, 2019.</span></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge Background &amp; Goals</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One goal of the challenge is to assess the potential of using virtual reality as a development tool to prototype and iterate on designs for public safety technology. Contestants will have the opportunity to enhance their prototypes after interacting with public safety stakeholders and receiving feedback on their designs. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This challenge also seeks to convene members of the haptic provider community and innovators in the development community to advance the state of haptic interfaces for public safety. </span><span lang=\"EN\">PSCR will keep the prototypes for future public safety demonstrations. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since 2002, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr\">PSCR</a> has collaborated with first responders, stakeholders, and innovators to ensure the development of reliable, intuitive, and mission-focused technologies for the public safety community.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In 2018, PSCR launched their first challenge in the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) series focused on advancing interfaces that allow a public safety user to effectively interact with and obtain information from the technology system(s) while ensuring the device is designed around public safety&rsquo;s operational needs. In 2018, PSCR named 6 winners in the Virtual Reality Heads-Up Display Navigation Challenge. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The contestants, consisting of <strong>Haptic Providers</strong> and <strong>Haptic Development Teams</strong>, and their haptic interface prototypes will be evaluated in two key areas:&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1) How the prototypes impact a first responder&rsquo;s performance in three virtual reality (VR) scenarios [law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and fire service] and </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">2) How, once embedded into firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE), the prototypes assist firefighters in a realistic scenario as they navigate and conduct a search and rescue task at a firefighter training facility.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task. After the completion of this challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes from Phase 4 and Phase 5 for future public safety demonstrations. Contestants are encouraged to develop multiple sets of prototypes throughout the challenge, in anticipation of this PSCR keeping the prototypes for demonstrations, and in case the contestants experience technical difficulties during later phases of the challenge.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"/community-library/1043/PSCR_HapticInterfacesforPublicSafetyChallenge_OfficialRules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View the a complete summary of contest phases and key dates</a>.</span></span></strong></p>\n<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>\n",

Further, there are multiple social factors that contribute to poor quality care and increased health care spending.</p>\n<p>AHRQ seeks to better understand unmet health service delivery needs in communities and develop ways to predict these needs at the population level. Understanding population-level behavior in relation to health care decision making is necessary for providing integrated, coordinated, whole person, 360-degree care; yet, information to support decision making about how to provide the quality health care to populations is incomplete. Evidence has suggested that social determinants of health[1] (SDoH) and community service digital data sets add important information that AHRQ may be able to use to better predict and plan for the optimal use of limited resources, improve population health outcomes, and drive savings.</p>\n<h4>Challenge Goal</h4>\n<p>The AHRQ Visualization Resources of Community-Level Social Determinants of Health Challenge seeks tools that support visualizing SDoH data clusters to enhance the research and analysis of community-level health services.</p>\n<p>Participants must develop visualization tools that draw information from at least three or more free, publicly available data source, whether federal, state or local. They may include data from voice and digital assistance requests via service lines, such as 911 emergency services, 311 community services, and 211 personal referrals for community services.  </p>\n<p>A list of these resources are provided on the AHRQ Challenge website.  These tools should be constructed and presented so that AHRQ can apply them in at least two of the following areas:&nbsp; develop studies (data linkage, machine learning, and modeling); relate initial consumer health-seeking behavior; evaluate health status, and; predict needs for emergency, hospital, and community health care services.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1]Healthy People 2020 defines social determinants of health as the conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. Conditions (e.g., social, economic, and physical) in these various environments and settings (e.g., school, church, workplace, and neighborhood) have been referred to as “place.” In addition to the more material attributes of “place,” the patterns of social engagement and sense of security and well-being are also affected by where people live. Resources that enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and environments free of life-threatening toxins.</p>\n",

Taking place throughout 2019 in ten different cities across the country, the challenge features ten contests which allow for on-line and in-person participation. Each contest is designed to develop new, creative technologies to address issues faced by fire, law enforcement and EMS emergency responders.</p> <p>The Tech to Protect Challenge is designed to engage entrepreneurs, technologists, students, programmers, designers and public safety experts to create solutions across critical technical areas of public safety communications, including secure communications, location-based services, public safety data analytics, mission-critical voice and user interface/user experience (UI/UX). The participant proposed solutions will support emergency responders&rsquo; use of advanced communications technologies in accomplishing their day to day activities, critical responsibilities in emergencies, and beyond.</p> <p>Over the course of 2019-2020, the challenge will include ten unique contests, host ten codeathons in cities across the United States, and award up to $2.2 million in cash prizes to participants. The challenge invites participants of all skill levels; provides opportunities to engage with subject matter experts; and offers access to resources needed to develop viable technology prototypes and solutions. The ten in-person codeathon events will take place in two bursts, September 27-29 and November 1-3, 2019, with the Online Contest launching a rolling application period between June 1 and November 16, 2019. Ultimately, a final national award event will be hosted in April 2020 to showcase and make the final cash awards to the top performing participants.</p> <p>Participants with diverse skill sets and varying levels of experience are welcome and encouraged to participate:</p> <ul> <li>Students, professionals and entrepreneurs with technical and non-technical backgrounds including engineers, computer scientists, software developers, designers, communications experts, illustrators, project managers and others.</li> <li>Emergency responders and others with an interest in public safety communications with technical and operational experience. This includes individuals with field experience, private and public entities that provide communications products or services, and individuals with an interest in software and hardware elements of communications technologies.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to NIST&rsquo;s Public Safety Communications Research Division, several co-sponsors and partnering organizations will be involved in the implementation of the challenge. The co-sponsors generally include public, private, and civic organizations such as technology solution providers, public safety-focused technology companies, public safety agencies and associations, universities, coding academies, and others &mdash; all in support of the participants and the challenge&rsquo;s objectives.</p> <p><strong>Questions?</strong></p> <p>Send an email to:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@techtoprotectchallenge.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">info@techtoprotectchallenge.org</a></p> </div>\n",

            "judging": "<div class=\"judging-criterias\"> <div> <h4>Judging Panels </h4> <p>Three judging panels will operate in a chronological series. Panels will be composed of a diverse group of individuals with specialized skills and experience relevant to the evaluation periods&rsquo; objectives. Each individual judge is appointed by the NIST Director, and required to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and conflict of interest (COI) disclosure to ensure that all participant materials are held in confidence and all judging is fair for participants.</p> <p>The Judge panel consists of experts who will evaluate the participants&rsquo; submissions according to the criteria defined for each contest. The objective of the judging will be to rank and select the top submissions in each period of evaluation. The decisions of the judges for the contest will be announced in accordance with the dates noted in the \"Important Dates\" section of these rules.</p> <p>In support of the judges and the evaluation process, reviewers are subject matter experts covered by NDA and COI requirements, who focus on implementing specific elements of the evaluation process. Reviewers provide evaluation support by assisting with the facilitation of the contests, implementing test and assessment activities, and other processes that generate data for the consideration of the judges, who are responsible for considering all the information and making the final decisions.</p> <p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Regional Codeathon Judging Panel</p> <p>The Regional Codeathon Judging Panel will be established to support the evaluation of submissions at each Regional Codeathon event. The judges will coordinate between individual codeathon events, in burst 1 and burst 2, to ensure consistency and uniform implementation of evaluation process.</p> <p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> Online Contest Judging Panel</p> <p>The Online Contest Judging Panel will be established to support the consolidated evaluation of online submissions and the &ldquo;best and final&rdquo; updated versions of Regional Codeathon submissions. The consolidated evaluation will be completed between November 16, 2019 and January 27, 2020 through an online judging process.</p> <p><strong>Panel 3:</strong> National Award Event Contest Judging Panel</p> <p>The National Judging Panel will be established to select the National Winners of the Tech to Protect Challenge.

This challenge includes ten unique contests and the evaluation process is designed to be as straightforward and simple as possible for participants to navigate. The graphic below represents the evaluation process that will be applied universally across all contests.</p> <p>Each contest includes evaluation criteria 0-5. Criteria 0 is a basic pass/fail compliance checklist of minimum requirements for submissions. Beyond the minimum requirements check, contests include up to five technical criteria used to evaluate submissions. Each technical criterion is weighted at 10-40 points out of a total of 100 points. Criteria items 0 through 3 will be used to evaluate Regional Codeathon and Online Contest submissions. Criteria items 4 and 5 represent the most advanced criteria items and will be used to evaluate the top submissions from the Online Contest, prior to selecting the National Finalists. Each of these five criteria items represent different features and attributes that the participant submissions will need to clearly demonstrate to the judges. The same evaluation process will be used throughout the challenge, with variation by contest for criteria 4-5. Each contest area has unique criteria, but in general examples may include aspects such as the application&rsquo;s UI/UX operability, accuracy, effectiveness, relevance to the contest&rsquo;s sample use case, and other similar elements.</p> <p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/TTP_evaluation_table.jpg\" width=\"671\" height=\"243\" alt=\"challenge evaluation table\" /></p> </div> <div> <h4>Regional Codeathon Evaluation </h4> <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Selection of up to the top 4 submissions per Regional Codeathon event.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Selection of one submission per contest (up to ten total) to be recognized at each Regional Codeathon event.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Process:</strong></p> <p>Regional Codeathon submissions will be evaluated by judges and reviewers at the end of each 48-hour codeathon event. <strong>Codeathon submissions will be evaluated against criteria items 0 through 3</strong> for a total of 60 rating points out of 100. A specific judging approach will be followed at the codeathon event, as described below. Participants will not be provided oral or written feedback based on the evaluation of their submissions.</p> <h4>Judging Phases</h4> <p><strong><span>Phase 1 - Initial compliance check</span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> Initial assessment on evaluation criteria /#0 items</span></p> <p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong></p>\n<p>● During the last day of each codeathon event, before the code freeze submission deadline, judges will review the progress of the teams towards meeting the criteria requirements of each respective contest. Judges will complete this initial review by interacting with participants. Judges will ask two questions to each participant. Judges will take notes on the progress of each participant at this stage during this initial assessment.</p> <hr /> <p><strong><span>Phase 2 - Rapid voting at code freeze </span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0-3</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> 3-minute review of each project&rsquo;s capabilities and selection of 4 projects or more to proceed to the next phase of evaluation.</span></p> <p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong></p> <p>● Quick, live demonstrations by the participating teams will be held in person at each participant&rsquo;s station during the rapid voting phase of each Regional Codeathon event. These demonstrations should happen right after the coding freeze deadline and last no longer than 3 minutes each. Participant teams should showcase the capabilities of the solutions and prototypes developed during this phase. SMEs and judges will rotate station to station to review the project demonstrations by the various teams. &lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● SME reviewers and judges will evaluate participant submissions by inputting a simple yes or no for each project in a form provided by the national organizers. These votes should be an approximate reflection of whether the teams have met the criteria items 0 to 3, as described in each of the unique contests.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● These ratings will be utilized to narrow down the list of teams that present projects during the next phase.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <hr /> <p><strong><span>Phase 3 - Judging Part A</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Participant presentations and judging</span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0-3</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> Teams present their projects in front of judges and are evaluated based on criteria items 0 to 3 per unique contest. </span></p> <p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong></p> <p>● Based on the initial voting, judges will invite teams to present their projects through a live presentation and PowerPoint slides. The presentations should take no more than 3 minutes, with an additional 3 minutes being available for questions and answers by the judges.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● Judges will evaluate participant submissions based on criteria items 0 to 3. This evaluation is unique to each contest and may require interactions in addition to the presentation to confirm technical or other elements of the participant&rsquo;s submission.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● Reviewers and judges will evaluate the participant&rsquo;s submission by inputting ratings in a form provided by the national organizers. &lt;/span&gt;</p> <hr /> <p><strong><span>Phase 4 - Judging Part B </span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Desk review of the submissions and final judging</span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0-3</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Detailed desk review of the submissions by the judges.

PSCR recognizes how cybersecurity affects every aspect of public safety communication. PSCR serves to develop and enhance security solutions to current and future public safety communications.</span> <span lang=\"EN\">This current Challenge complements public safety-specific Federated Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) research conducted by PSCR with other <a href=\"http://nist.gov/cyber\">NIST</a> laboratories, such as NIST&rsquo;s Information Technology Laboratory and their National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Challenge will convene first responders, mobile device providers, network providers, authentication providers, researchers, and solvers in order to collaborate and advance the state of mobile device security for public safety. PSCR and their co-sponsors are requesting solvers&rsquo; assistance to explore the possibilities for using the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), commonly known as the SIM card, as a secure storage container for application credentials.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span>By leveraging solvers&rsquo; outside-of-the-box thinking to create innovative two-factor authentication solutions while educating public safety stakeholders on the benefit of authentication standards.</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The SIM card, already used in most mobile devices, has characteristics that make it a robust storage device for critical mobile network subscriber data. The SIM card is a tamper-resistant hardware storage container and, if utilized as an application credential storage container, would enable applications to use the authentication credentials provisioned to it seamlessly. The SIM card offers several usability benefits for public safety, as it would be more user friendly; allow networks to provision credentials over-the-air via a secure channel; and potentially enable device sharing by keeping sensitive information on the removable SIM card. Additionally, as the SIM card is currently used in every mobile device, it could offer cost savings for public safety units as extra hardware would not be necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Challenge includes three phases and requires contestants to:&nbsp; securely store a fire on a SIM card; create a mobile application that accesses a user&rsquo;s credentials stored on a SIM card; and authenticates to a FIDO 2 service provider.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Each contestant will be evaluated individually against the listed evaluation criteria, and successful contestants will be invited to move to the next phase. Invited contestants will be awarded cash prizes at the end of Phase 1 ($1,000) and Phase 2 ($2,000) to assist with developing a prototype for Phase 3. The scores from the final phase will be the basis for the final prize challenge awards PSCR will award up to $100,000 to the winners of the Challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In addition to cash prize awards, contestants will be given the opportunity to obtain feedback from industry, such as the co-sponsoring entities, through planned webinars and other sessions, in an effort to advance both their prototypes and their connections in the public safety and communications technology communities. After the completion of this Challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes for future public safety demonstrations.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Should a contestant prove successful, their solution could provide significant time and cost savings for public safety units; for example, the solution would provide:</span></p>\n<ul> <li>Increased security of public safety data on mobile/portable devices;</li> <li>Additional credential storage container without an external, bulky device;</li> <li>Sharing of mobile devices by multiple users by exchanging SIMs;<!-- [if !supportLists]--></li> <li><span lang=\"EN\">Spur ideas for other potential hardware authentication solutions on mobile devices;</span></li> <li>Increased versatility by adding the ability to provision credentials to the SIM card remotely; and</li> <li>Potential cost savings as public safety units would not need to purchase separate hardware authentication tokens.</li> </ul>\n<p><a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/NISTPSCR_ExpandingtheSIMCardUseforPublicSafety_OfficialRules.pdf\">View the complete summary of contest phases and key dates.</a></p>\n",

How can the government improve collaboration with leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers, academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.</p> <h4><strong>What is the GEAR Center?</strong></h4> <p>As described in the Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center</a> could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p> <h4><strong>What is the Challenge?</strong></h4> <p>This competition challenges \"Solvers\" (participating individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges facing government described in the current <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). For example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?</p> <p>Before the government invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.</p> <p>As a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the interagency GEAR Team <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/stakeholders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared the results of the Request for Information</a>, in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PMA-related challenges</a> (pg. 4, 7-9).</p> <h4><strong>What is the Prize?</strong></h4> <p>GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges, but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the same PMA-related challenge.</p> <p>Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions that would:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Transform the way the Federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.</li> <li>Empower external users to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.</li> <li>Better connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve Federal services.</li> <li>Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address issues described in the President's Management Agenda.</li> </ul> <p><strong>On May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions</strong>&nbsp;and allow interested Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges.

Moreover, many businesses not only face a challenge when attempting to find individuals with the technical or hard skills needed to perform the work required by their industries, but also have difficulty finding individuals with the soft skills necessary to be successful in the workplace.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">SBA believes that existing Makerspaces are uniquely positioned to help address this problem.&nbsp; The non-profit organization Maker City posits a strong connection between makerspaces and workforce development in U.S. cities, with numerous benefits including:&nbsp; embracing independent work and self-employment, focus on new forms of vocational education, opportunity to focus on &ldquo;jobs in the middle&rdquo; which match makers to those seeking traditional employment, development of new forms of apprenticeship, and a shift to new forms of credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; SBA proposes a pilot program that will utilize existing Makerspaces to provide the necessary job specific and soft skills training and, to the extent feasible, any required industry or trade certifications (the &ldquo;MaTCH Pilot Competition&rdquo;).&nbsp; The goal of the The Makerspace Training, Collaboration, and Hiring (MaTCH) Pilot Competition, upon successful completion of the training program, is to have all program graduates immediately placed in positions with previously identified employers that are in need of skilled labor and have committed to employing a set number of program graduates.</span></p>\n<p>For more information, <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/match/match-competition-faq\">view MaTCH Competition FAQs</a>.</p>\n",

Prize competition applications consist of a brief twelve-slide presentation and an optional two-minute video.</p>\n<p><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong> SBA is seeking to identify the nation's most innovative and promising small business accelerators and incubators that work with high tech entrepreneurs that are potential SBIR or STTR program applicants (see more information about SBIR/STTR below). These accelerators and incubators help entrepreneurs speed the launch, growth, and scale of their businesses and, ultimately, the creation of jobs. <strong>The Competition awards will infuse the accelerators and incubators with additional resource capital to help these entities provide focused assistance to high tech entrepreneurs, including support for company formation as well as awareness and education of the SBIR and STTR programs.</strong></p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Competition, the accelerators and incubators are referred to as Growth Accelerators (or Accelerators) and include accelerators, incubators, co-working startup communities, or other models to accomplish similar goals.</p>\n<p>SBIR and STTR refer to the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Tech Transfer programs. &nbsp;These programs provide small businesses with financial capital and research and development funds to develop high-tech, high-growth, commercially viable innovations. &nbsp;Additional information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.sbir.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.sbir.gov</a></p>\n<p><strong>PRIZES FOR WINNERS:</strong> In total, SBA will award up to 60 prizes of $50,000 each, for a total of up to $3 million in prizes under this announcement.</p>\n<p><strong>DATES:</strong> The submission period for entries begins at 12:00 p.m. EDT, June 10, 2019, and ends June 20, 2019, at 4:59 p.m. EDT.

            "description": "<p>In June, 2019, the U.S. Department of Energy Water Power Technologies Office launched a prize to develop wave energy powered desalination systems. The Waves to Water Prize is a 4-Stage, $2.5M contest to accelerate the development of small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of providing potable drinking water in disaster relief scenarios and remote coastal locations.</p>\n\n<p>This is the second stage of this prize, the DESIGN Stage, which offers competitors up to $800,000 in cash prizes. This DESIGN Stage asks competitors to submit a plan and provide detailed modeling of the system.</p>\n\n<p>The Prize aims to attract dedicated teams of highly capable individuals and provide them with sufficient incentives so that they will advance their technologies through completion of the prize. While the technology development goals of the prize are specifically tailored to address the unique circumstances around disaster response or remote coastal community water needs, the purpose is also to advance technologies that could have broader applications for wave energy and desalination technologies.

Compasses &mdash; both digital and analog &mdash; are oriented by the magnetic force at a user&rsquo;s location. Since geographic and magnetic poles do not align, geomagnetic models like the World Magnetic Model (WMM) correct for this difference.</p>\n<p>As the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is constantly changing, the difference between geographic and magnetic poles also changes, and the WMM must be regularly updated.</p>\n<p><strong>An opportunity to rethink geomagnetic data collection</strong></p>\n<p>Production of the WMM currently uses space-based magnetic field measurements that the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission has provided since 2013. Swarm mission satellites contain several instruments capable of producing a variety of measurements, including magnetic vector field measurements. To ensure sustainability of the WMM, the U.S. government is taking a proactive approach to identifying new methods of data collection independent of Swarm.</p>\n<p><strong>The World Magnetic Model is used every day around the world</strong></p>\n<p>The WMM is embedded in thousands of systems. More than a billion smartphone users depend on the WMM to point them in the right direction when they use mobile navigation apps. Drivers rely on the WMM to power the compasses in their cars. The WMM is also critical for military and commercial uses around the world. Among other applications, it supports navigation and attitude determination for submarines, satellites, and aircraft, while also informing operational logistics like the numbering of runways.</p>\n<p><strong>MagQuest, a multiphase open innovation challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) calls upon solvers to submit novel approaches to geomagnetic data collection for the World Magnetic Model. This open innovation challenge is designed to attract new ideas to increase the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of geomagnetic data collection. With MagQuest, NGA aims to inspire domestic and international solvers to apply their expertise to spaceborne, aerial, terrestrial, and other potential solution areas. Solvers from small businesses, academic institutions, labs, startups, and other organizations are encouraged to enter the competition. (See Additional Resources for an overview of potential solution areas.)</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Phases (Overview)</strong></p>\n<p>MagQuest Phases 1-2 (March 2019 through September 2019) will award a total of $1.2 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p>\n<p>In Phase 1, MagQuest sought concepts that proposed novel methods or technologies that may be promising to provide sufficient data for the WMM. Submissions opened March 21, 2019 and closed May 16, 2019. 10 winners were nominated by the judges according to official Phase 1 selection criteria and the total Phase 1 prize pool of $200,000 will be distributed evenly across Phase 1 winners.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 2 is open to solvers from Phase 1, as well as new solvers who did not participate in the first phase of the challenge. Success in Phase 2 may require greater breadth of expertise, and participants have the opportunity to form expanded teams. See the <a href=\"https://www.magquest.com/solver-community\">Solver Community</a> for information on potential team collaboration.</p>\n<p>In Phase 2:</p>\n<ul> <li>The challenge seeks detailed designs and plans for data collection methodologies, including a concept of operations, a description of expected performance and potential risks, and an overview of potential future program management.</li> <li>A successful Phase 2 design will detail all elements of a solution:&nbsp; sensor, platform, and data analysis. The sensor is the instrumentation that makes geomagnetic field measurements, the platform holds or carries this instrumentation, and data analysis refers to the mechanism for processing and distributing data.</li> <li>Submissions will open June 20, 2019 and close August 28, 2019.</li> <li>Educational webinars will be hosted in Phase 2 for interested solvers. Potential webinar topics include an orientation to Phase 2 submissions and teaming information, a technical deep-dive on relevant submission topics, and an overview of regulatory or commercialization considerations. More webinar details will be provided as they are confirmed.</li> <li>Up to five (5) winners will be nominated by the judges according to official Phase 2 selection criteria. The total Phase 2 prize pool of $1 million will be distributed across Phase 2 winners.&nbsp;</li> <li>As part of their acceptance of the associated Phase 2 monetary prize, winners will agree to have a brief synopsis of their concept published on the MagQuest website.</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>Although agencies are adopting secure cloud technologies at record-high levels, challenges remain within the FedRAMP process and across the FISMA and Risk Management Framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.fedramp.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)</a> strives to continuously improve how we support our customers. In an effort to enhance and evolve our program, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) seeks to leverage the power and insights of the cybersecurity community. Respondents have the opportunity to help guide what the PMO takes on next and ensure that the government keeps federal data secure while bolstering modernization efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>\n<p>Participants should submit bold, innovative, and actionable ideas that offer a new perspective on the FedRAMP Authorization process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Security and cloud professionals, academia, and anyone interested or involved in the FedRAMP ecosystem are invited to participate in this opportunity to share their best thinking on the next phase of FedRAMP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p>\n<p>As technology evolves, it is important that federal agencies manage information systems to address and mitigate security risks. We want to ensure FedRAMP continuously explores initiatives in support of a modern, efficient, and effective authorization process in an effort to reduce time and cost, without compromising cybersecurity rigor.</p>\n<p>This challenge provides FedRAMP&rsquo;s stakeholders and the cloud security community at large the opportunity to directly inform and contribute ideas in support of a new approach to risk assessments and security authorization for cloud products and services.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>FedRAMP standardizes the Federal Government&rsquo;s requirements and approach to security assessment, authorization, and monitoring of cloud products and services. The FedRAMP program established several cloud security baselines in accordance with <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf\">FISMA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf\">OMB A-130</a> and aligned with the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/risk-management-framework-(RMF)-Overview\">NIST RMF</a> and <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-53r4.pdf\">NIST SP 800-53.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In accordance with FISMA, each agency is required to issue an Authority to Operate (ATO) to authorize operation and accept the risk of using an information system. FISMA, and the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-strengthening-cybersecurity-federal-networks-critical-infrastructure/\">President&rsquo;s Executive Order,</a> require agency heads to be responsible for information security risk within that agency and, while FedRAMP helps streamline and support agency risk determinations, ultimately that responsibility lies with the individual agency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FedRAMP&rsquo;s unified approach allows CSPs to demonstrate how they are safeguarding information using a single set of security requirements that is accepted by all executive branch departments and agencies. This &ldquo;do once, use many&rdquo; approach minimizes duplicative agency-specific authorization efforts, inconsistencies, and cost inefficiencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FedRAMP works closely with partners from industry and government to promote the secure adoption of innovative information technologies. The FedRAMP PMO takes a continuous improvement mindset to its mission of creating transparent standards and processes to&nbsp; accelerate federal agencies&rsquo; adoption of cloud technologies and ability to leverage security authorizations on a government-wide scale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How Do CSPs Get a FedRAMP Authorization?</strong></p>\n<p>CSPs can achieve a FedRAMP Authorization for their Cloud Service Offering (CSO) from one of two approaches:&nbsp; through agency partnership or through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB). Regardless of the authorization approach, the CSP and 3PAO must produce the same deliverables (documents, artifacts, and evidence files) to convey the risk associated with the CSO.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/jab-authorization/\">JAB Authorization Process</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/jab-auth.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/agency-authorization/\">Agency Authorization Process</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/agency-auth.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Challenges with the &ldquo;As-Is&rdquo; FedRAMP Process</strong></p>\n<p>As agencies migrate to cloud technology, authorization challenges remain. FedRAMP is committed to providing workable and scalable solutions for our partners to advance the pace of secure cloud adoption. The FedRAMP PMO identified four improvement areas to the current &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Current Challenges</p>\n<ul> <li>Time - Although there has been significant progress in reducing authorization timelines, more work is needed to improve the pace of authorizing new providers, approving significant changes, and on-boarding of new services.&nbsp;</li> <li>Cost - The technical modifications, testing, and security materials required for a vendor to achieve a FedRAMP Authorization is comprehensive and rigorous.&nbsp; Depending on a vendor&rsquo;s familiarity with these requirements, and the current &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; environment, costs can quickly escalate.&nbsp;</li> <li>Reciprocity - Some agencies are not accepting FedRAMP Authorizations at face-value and require additional security requirements in addition to the FedRAMP baseline. This action transforms the ATO process from a risk-enabling practice to a labor-intensive exercise and loses sight of FedRAMP&rsquo;s intended &ldquo;do once, use many&rdquo; goal.&nbsp;</li> <li>Awareness - There are misperceptions that can potentially dissuade a CSP or Agency from participating in the program. There are several awareness challenges associated with the process, associated roles and responsibilities and available resources, including the <a href=\"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?sort=productName\">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>.&nbsp;</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Helpful Resources and Where to Start</strong></p>\n<p>The FedRAMP PMO launched multiple projects and initiatives in the past in response to customer feedback.

            "judging": "<p><strong>Scope:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The Challenge evaluation will focus on AI/ML technologies that detect malware on an endpoint. The following describes the scope of the candidate technologies:</p>\n<ul> <li>This evaluation is focused on detecting malware at the endpoint. Network-based tools (such as network intrusion detection systems) or network-based systems that reconstruct and analyze files from network traffic are not eligible.</li> <li>Malware detection tools will classify malware on the host:&nbsp; <ul> <li>within the filesystem statically or dynamically, including addition, alteration or replacement of authorized operating system, application, or user files; or</li> <li>with fileless techniques (e.g. identifying fileless malware that sits in memory as executable instructions); or</li> <li>based on other host activities (e.g., logs indicating encrypted command and control communications).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Technologies are expected to have an artificial intelligence and/or machine learning component (e.g., static or dynamic analysis and classifier), with the option to include other complementary approaches, such as signature-based detection.</li> <li>Technologies must operate on-premises, whether solely at the endpoint or in coordination with a local network-level appliance or VM that emulates a cloud analytic capability.</li> <li>To measure how AI/ML improves malware detection, the test data will use public and private benign and malicious samples.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Test Evaluation Process:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation team will review the white papers in order to better understand the tool.&nbsp; The actual test evaluation process of the tool will involve the delivery of multiple file test samples to virtual machines (VMs) running the Participant&rsquo;s malware detection technology. For each test sample (benign or malicious file), the following procedures will be performed on the tool:</p>\n<ul> <li>A VM will be instantiated with the Participant&rsquo;s malware detection technology installed and running.</li> <li>The following information will be recorded for evaluation during a set time interval in which the sample, a file or fileless malware/benign-ware, is present on the VM:&nbsp; <ul> <li>The classification decision for the sample, under the following constraints:&nbsp; <ul> <li>The label must identify whether benign or malicious and be time stamped. In the event there is no label given in the time interval or the tool does not produce a log or result for the sample, the classification will be interpreted as a benign label with maximum timestamp for that time interval.</li> <li>At most one label shall be given per sample. Other peripheral information beyond the required classification decision (e.g. taxonomy, confidence score, etc.) may also be provided, but will not be used in scoring of the Participant technology.</li> <li>The output classification and any peripheral information must be programmatically accessible by the evaluation team. Documentation of the classification logging approach and format must be provided by the Participant. For example, time-tagged logging content may be:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Sent to a logging server/SIEM, such as Splunk.</li> <li>Logged to syslog, a local file, or windows event logs.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Resource usage by only the Participant technology for the duration of the test sample&rsquo;s VM as follows:</li> <li>CPU usage per second</li> <li>Volatile memory usage per second</li> <li>Disk I/O per second</li> <li>Network I/O per second</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the Participant&rsquo;s technology uses an on-premises appliance for dynamic or static analysis, or AI/ML analysis, either via a hardware appliance or a virtual machine, resource usage of the management console will be recorded as well as for the VM containing the test sample. If the on-premises appliance only manages endpoint agents, the usage will <strong>not</strong> be recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>\n<p>Each candidate technology will be scored based on the aggregate performance of their technology when tested against benign and malicious file samples. The score will be in terms of a cost estimate, and will sum the following:</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Simulated attack cost:</strong> A cost function will be used to compute estimated attack costs of each malicious file based on the file&rsquo;s negative effects. The functions will be increasing in time, so that early detection will incur less costs than later detection. Note that in the case of a true positive (correct classification of the malicious sample) only the attack cost up to the detection time is accrued. In the case of a false negative (no alert on a malicious sample) the attack cost for the whole test period will be incurred. For false positive (alerting upon a benign sample) and true negative (correctly not alerting upon a benign sample) scenarios, there is no attack and thus no attack costs will be accrued.</li> <li><strong>Simulated security operator cost:</strong> Costs for handling alerts will be computed. This includes only the costs for handling true positive and false positive scenarios, respectively. These will be estimated from actual manpower costs incurred by security operation centers to triage, investigate, and document host alerts. In the case of the true negative or false negative scenario, there are no alerts and hence no operator costs are accrued.</li> <li><strong>Simulated host resource cost:&nbsp; </strong>Costs for the use of host resources will be accrued throughout the duration of the event. The resources monitored on each host are as follows:&nbsp; <ul> <li>CPU usage per second</li> <li>Volatile memory usage per second</li> <li>Disk I/O per second</li> <li>Network I/O per second</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n<p>The simulated costs of each resource itemized above will be estimated from current rates. These simulated resource costs are accrued regardless of correct (true positive, true negative) or incorrect (false positive, false negative) classification. Note that in the case of a true negative (correctly not alerting on a benign sample), only host resource costs (no attack cost and no operator costs) will be accrued.</p>\n<p><strong>THE WINNERS OF THE CHALLENGE WILL BE THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE LOWEST COMPUTED TOTAL COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCORING ABOVE. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Environment:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation environment will be VMs. Submitted technologies do not have to be compatible with all tested platforms, but must be compatible with at least one. The two evaluation platforms include the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit</li> <li>CentOS 7 64-bit</li> </ul>\n<p>The operating systems will have the following additional user software installed as a baseline:</p>\n<ul> <li>Windows:&nbsp; Microsoft Office, Java, Adobe PDF Reader</li> <li>CentOS:&nbsp; OpenOffice, Java, Adobe PDF Reader</li> </ul>\n<p>The host-based endpoint agents must be able to be installed on the Windows VM through either a GUI, console, or powershell using standard Windows installation procedures. On CentOS, an RPM-compatible or RHEL-distribution compatible installer must be provided. Documentation describing the installation procedures should also be provided when submitting the tool, in accordance with the tool submission guidelines provided above.</p>\n<p>If the technology requires an on-premises management appliance or console, then software and/or hardware components for the management appliance should be provided upon submission of the white paper <strong>no later than 30 September 2019 at 1700 EDT.</strong> The components to run the management console must include documentation necessary for installation and a three-month evaluation license if needed. The software and/or hardware components for the on-premises console must be one of the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>Exported Virtual Machine Image (e.g. .ova, .qcow2, etc.) that can be ran with a libvirt-compatible hypervisor (e.g. QEMU, XenServer, VMWare, Virtualbox, Emulab, etc.)</li> <li>Software packages needed to install the appliance, rather than providing the entire virtual machine image.</li> <li>If not an OVA or similar image, a <em>standalone </em>hardware appliance that <em>will not be </em>connected to external cloud services.</li> </ul>\n",

The final Phase 1 winners were announced in June 2017.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 of the Space Robotics Challenge is seeking to foster the creation or advancement of autonomous capabilities of lunar surface robots. Future ISRU missions may occur on surfaces such as Earth's moon, and will likely need to operate autonomously for long periods of time before, during, and after the presence of astronauts. Robots that can successfully perform ISRU tasks with little to no human intervention are valuable due to both the communication latencies and limited bandwidth between these destinations and Earth. Additionally, NASA has unique constraints for robotic systems in space compared to terrestrial applications, namely the radiation and thermal environments encountered, which affect the processing and sensing capabilities available for robotic systems. It is also recognized that many of the robotic capabilities needed for future exploration missions could have highly valuable functionality for terrestrial robotic applications, such as disaster relief, exploration of difficult and/or dangerous terrains, and industrial plant maintenance and servicing.</p>\n<p>The focus of SRC Phase 2 is on the ability of virtual robotic systems to perform a long-term fully-autonomous ISRU mission for the Moon. This challenge will require competitors to develop software that allows a team of virtual robots (i.e., virtual robotic team) to operate fully autonomously for a specified length of time.

This widespread problem takes a variety of forms, including sexual, psychological, community, economic, institutional, and intimate partner violence, and in turn affects nearly every aspect of a person's life, including health, education, and economic and political opportunities. At the same time, environmental degradation, loss of ecosystem benefits, and unsustainable resource use are creating complex crises worldwide. As billions of people rely on these natural resources and ecosystems to sustain themselves, the potential human impacts are dire, with disproportionate effects on women and girls.</p>\n<p>GBV and environmental issues are interlinked, and so their interactions are complex, diverse, and multi-layered. In some contexts, they form feedback loops where gender-based attacks, harassment, and discrimination worsens the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resources, and this environmental deterioration triggers new, more damaging forms of violence. In other contexts, preventing and responding to GBV unlocks opportunities for enhanced environmental action, as well as for women's and community empowerment.</p>\n<p>USAID is seeking to fund the innovative application of promising or proven interventions that prevent and respond to gender-based violence across programs that address the access, use, control, and management of natural resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dates:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Launch:&nbsp; 15 August 2019</li> <li>Questions due:&nbsp; 8 September 2019</li> <li>Webinar:&nbsp; 10 September 2019</li> <li>Application deadline:&nbsp; 8 October 2019</li> <li>Finalist interviews:&nbsp; 23 October - 1 November 2019</li> <li>Winner workshop:&nbsp; 18-22 November 2019</li> <li>Winners announced:&nbsp; 20 November 2019</li> <li>Implementation:&nbsp; 22 November 2019 - 31 December 2021</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>Water infrastructure in the United States is critical to the domestic economy, commerce, and resource management. There are thousands of existing hydraulic steel structures (HSS) that require regular maintenance and upkeep. Original methods to protect HSS are disfavored or no longer used due to environmental and safety concerns. Newer approaches to corrosion control suffer from higher costs, shorter service life, and reduced efficacy.</p>\n<p>In order to address rising maintenance costs and to advance the state of the art for corrosion control, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), is sponsoring this two phase Rust Busters Challenge. This Challenge seeks to identify and develop new methods for corrosion control. The Challenge sponsors are vitally interested in completely new approaches that are outside of conventional thought processes for corrosion control that can be applied to existing structures in situ. There is also interest in advancing existing technologies that can significantly improve service life, reduce costs (through innovative application methods or use of new materials), or improve performance range (through additional features such as health monitoring or self-healing).</p>\n<p>This Rust Busters Challenge offers the opportunity for the most compelling corrosion control approaches to be evaluated and field-tested by the Challenge sponsors. In Phase 1, participants will submit a paper containing the proposed approach to corrosion control, its scientific rationale, and any supporting data. Up to 5 of the most compelling submissions will be selected as Phase 1 winners. Only Phase 1 winners can participate in Phase 2, and each Phase 1 winner will receive up to $50,000 to help support Phase 2 efforts. During Phase 2, participants will demonstrate their technologies using test coupons supplied by Reclamation. Test coupons and/or prototypes will be evaluated by Reclamation, and up to 3 final winners will share the final prize of $100,000. This Challenge has a total prize purse of $350,000 ($250,000 in Phase 1 and $100,000 in Phase 2). It offers a rare opportunity for Phase 2 participants to receive field-test data for their technologies and additional possibilities to continue working with Reclamation to further develop their technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>KEY DATES</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Pre-Registration:</strong> August 22 &ndash; September 19, 2019</li> <li><strong>Phase 1 Key Dates (anticipated)</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Submissions:</strong> September 19, 2019 &ndash; January 16, 2020</li> <li><strong>Judging:</strong> January 2020 &ndash; February 2020</li> <li><strong>Phase 1 Winners Announced:</strong> March 2020</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Phase 2 Key Dates (anticipated)</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Prototype Development:</strong> March 2020 to September 2020</li> <li><strong>Prototype Testing and Evaluation:&nbsp; </strong>September 2020 to December 2021</li> <li><strong>Best in Lab Performance Winner Announcement:</strong> March 2021</li> <li><strong>Phase 2 Winner Announcement:</strong> December 2021</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n",

Through 12-week sprints, TOP challenges technologists outside of government – companies, non-profits, and universities – to create digital tools with Census and other federal open data to expand American economic opportunity.</p>\n<p>TOP works with experts from the Census Bureau and other federal agencies to identify high-priority challenges facing the public, and then engages experts from the private and nonprofit sectors through technology development sprints. Each 12-week sprint results in new data-driven tools that directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions with open data. </p>\n<p>Since launching in 2016, 30 federal agencies and over 100 external organizations including companies, universities and community organizations have worked together to create 80 new digital products for the public.  These products provide solutions to challenges including the opioid crisis, disaster response, connecting veterans with jobs, promoting STEM education, and more. </p>\n<p>TOP supports the Census Bureau’s mission and Title 13 mandate to disseminate data to the public. It is also a component of the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Presidents-Management-Agenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President’s Management Agenda</a> — namely, <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal 2:&nbsp; Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset</a>, championed by Commerce Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley, which focuses on utilizing data as an asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, promote transparency, and make government data more useful to the public, businesses, and researchers. TOP is also a <a href=\"https://strategy.data.gov/proof-points/2019/04/26/helping-baltimore-volunteers-find-where-to-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Proof Point</a> within the first ever <a href=\"https://strategy.data.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Data Strategy</a>.</p>\n<h4>The Problem</h4>\n<p>Over 9 sprint cycles and nearly 4 years, it has become clear that one of the greatest challenges associated with civic technology development is product sustainability and adoption – in short, what happens to these solutions after The Opportunity Project sprint process. Now, in order to help advance some of the most promising technology solutions developed through The Opportunity Project, the Census Bureau is launching a Prize Challenge to help tech teams deploy their technology solutions, ensure they reach end users and drive impact on the critical problems they aim to solve. This prize challenge is open to teams that have previously participated or are currently participating in The Opportunity Project, and built a digital product with open data through an Opportunity Project facilitated sprint or utilizing <a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov/toolkit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Opportunity Project toolkit, which provides a step-by-step outline for replicating the sprint process</a>. <strong>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</strong></p>\n<h4>Challenge Goals and Categories</h4>\n<p>The Opportunity Project Prize Challenge is a new opportunity for teams who have participated in The Opportunity Project to compete for funding to expand their impact, deploy tools to end users, and begin to or continue to deliver impact on critical problems facing the public.</p>\n<p>Because the challenges tackled in The Opportunity Project to date are so broad, COIL has identified five categories that capture a range of critical problems, described below. Teams applying for the prize must submit their product in at least one category, and can submit in up to 2 categories. </p>\n<ol> <li><strong>2020 Census:&nbsp; Reaching Hard-to-Count Communities</strong>:&nbsp; e.g., products focusing on challenges such as increasing response rates in hard-to-count communities, bridging the digital divide, promoting online self-response through digital literacy, and promoting 2020 Census jobs;</li> <li><strong>Revolutionizing the Workforce:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as employment, training, education, supporting entrepreneurship, creating multiple pathways for careers, and developing regional talent pipelines for high growth development; </li> <li><strong>Building Thriving Communities:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as affordable housing, transportation information and infrastructure, public safety, investment in communities, and community infrastructure development;  </li> <li><strong>Creating Resilient People and Places:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as disaster preparedness and response, environmental stewardship, and local address databases to support first responders and other community needs; </li> <li><strong>Creating the Future of Health:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as the opioid crisis, connecting patients with clinical trials, public health and disease prevention, emotional wellbeing, and tick borne diseases.</li> </ol>\n<p>**If you missed the May 21 Informational Webinar on The Opportunity Project Prize Challenge, you can view the recording at <a href=\"https://www.uberconference.com/getmp3/AMIfv95Ryev7gx3KRzgJRi2_Ga3R1PhHVB4_foRTTZ-UxzP1MQdrmxvbBo2CrxOYkkg_nt8t8UPfxxHHlKBC5xZYKF6LxgdrE09G0uvwf6zY0bHpK0TZYYPOIW161HG7JCB24zW2xwWNxc2Vob87dlXTUE0xK5B9_A.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>.** </p>\n",

Before responders can act in the affected area, they need to know the location, cause and severity of damage. But disasters can strike anywhere, disrupting local communication and transportation infrastructure, making the process of assessing specific local damage difficult, dangerous, and slow.</p>\n<p><strong>Raw Imagery is Not Enough</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/xview2.png\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\" alt=\"disaster relief satellite image\" /></p>\n<p>Satellite imagery can provide unbiased overhead views, but raw imagery is not enough to inform recovery efforts. High-resolution imagery is required to see specific damage conditions, but because disasters cover a large ground area, analysts must search through huge swaths of pixel space to localize and score damage in the area of interest. Then annotated imagery must be summarized and communicated to the recovery team. It is a slow and laborious process.</p>\n<p><strong>Solving a Common Problem</strong></p>\n<p>Recognizing an opportunity to solve a key analytical bottleneck, the Defense Innovation Unit, together with other Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Recovery (HADR) organizations, is releasing a new labeled, high-resolution satellite dataset and a challenge to the computer vision community.</p>\n",

Solvers will be ranked in descending order, with highest score first and lowest score last. Further detail on the scoring methodology is available on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://xview2.org/challenge\">Challenge</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://xview2.org/rules\">Rules</a>&nbsp;pages on this site.</p>\n<p>(B) Ties Ranked by Submission Time. In the event of a tie between participants, the one with the earliest submission time will be ranked first while the one with the later submission time will be ranked lower. DIU reserves the right to break ties when necessary based on finer time precision than displayed on the public leaderboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Inputs</strong></p>\n<p>Given a pair of pre/post images, your model must localize and classify building damage. Input images are square RGB image files in PNG format, with height and width of 1024 pixels. Pre/post pairs are identified by matching numerical IDs for each set of pre/post filenames. For the training data, filenames also include information about the disaster, but disaster information is obfuscated in the test dataset.</p>\n<p><strong>Outputs</strong></p>\n<p>Your model must predict an output PNG image with height and width of 1024 pixels, where each pixel value corresponds to the predicted class at that place in the input image:</p>\n<ul> <li>0:&nbsp; no building</li> <li>1:&nbsp; undamaged building</li> <li>2:&nbsp; building with minor damage</li> <li>3:&nbsp; building with major damage</li> <li>4:&nbsp; destroyed building</li> </ul>\n<p>Localization is scored against the building polygons annotated in the \"pre\" images, at each pixel location. Damage classification is scored against the damage levels annotated in the \"post\" images, at each pixel location.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseline model</strong></p>\n<p>A public baseline model is currently being evaluated to establish public benchmark performance levels. The code and results for the baseline model will be available soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Upload Your Predictions</strong></p>\n<p>The first step in a submission is uploading your predictions for the test dataset, which you should compute offline on your own. Download the test dataset, compute a prediction for each of the instances in the test set, and then upload your predictions for evaluation and display on the public leaderboard. You may elect to upload submissions anonymously, which will display \"Anonymous\" for that submission on the leaderboard. Solvers may upload one submission at a time; a maximum of three submissions per day will be evaluated. Baseline models are currently being evaluated to establish public benchmark performance levels; leaderboard functionality will be available soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Submit your Container for Verification</strong></p>\n<p>The best results on the leaderboard will be eligible for online container verification; a successful container verification is required to complete a submission and be eligible for awards. To submit your container for verification, you must containerize your code to compute one prediction, push your container to Docker Hub in a public or private account, authorize the Challenge Sponsor to pull your container, and then use the form to submit a container verification job. If the results of your container evaluation are the same as your previously uploaded predictions, your container is successfully verified. A tutorial and further details will be available when leaderboard functionality is active. Container verification submissions may be made from public or private repositories. Container verification is part of the submission process, and a successful container verification is required to be eligible for awards.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Metric</strong></p>\n<p>The overall ranking metric for the xView2 Challenge is combined F1 score. Submissions are evaluated over the test dataset to compute a localization F1 score and a damage classification F1 score. Localization F1 scores the agreement between your predictions (0 = no building, or 1-4 = building) at each pixel location versus the ground truth labels for the \"pre\" image. Damage classification F1 scores the agreement between your predictions (1 = no damage, 2 = minor damage, 3 = major damage, 4 = destroyed) over the pixels of each building polygon in the ground truth of the \"post\" images. The overall F1 score is 30% localization F1 + 70% damage classification F1.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong><u>The Challenge:&nbsp; An Inclusive Talent Pipeline for American Businesses</u></strong></p>\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for American businesses to expand human capital pipelines by drawing upon highly talented and diverse workforces, inclusive of people with disabilities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To achieve this, the Inclusive Talent Pipeline for American Businesses challenge will support rapid innovation and adoption of models that help businesses improve performance by recruiting and retaining workers with disabilities, including people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>People with disabilities use creativity to navigate the world, and in turn they develop unique strengths, such as problem-solving skills, persistence, forethought and an eagerness to innovate &mdash; all of which are essential to today&rsquo;s market. American businesses that employ and support workers with disabilities see improved performance over their industry peers. On average these firms have:</p>\n<ul> <li>28% higher revenue, double the net income, and</li> <li>30% higher economic profit margins compared to businesses that did not engage in disability employment and inclusion efforts.<sup>1</sup></li> </ul>\n<p>In addition, companies that employ and support workers with disabilities were twice as likely as companies that do not to have higher total shareholder returns than their peers.&nbsp; Further:</p>\n<ul> <li>Innovation leads to the development of products and programs that are accessible for all.</li> <li>Investors increasingly scrutinize company culture and diversity, including disability inclusion, in investment decisions.</li> <li>Inclusive business environments often see improved productivity levels with the addition of employees with disabilities.</li> </ul>\n<p>People with disabilities also are an important population for businesses that are working to achieve greater diversity and inclusion of their workforce. With this challenge, ACL is seeking commitments from businesses to include employees with disabilities, particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, in their inclusion and diversity efforts and their talent pipeline programs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the workforce pipelines proposed here will enable businesses to benefit from the talents of a wider, more diverse workforce and ensure more Americans with disabilities are able to advance and compete in the future economy.&nbsp; ACL recognizes that businesses &ndash; from Wall Street to Main Street &ndash; are critical partners for identifying and testing solutions to this challenge.</p>\n<p>The challenge will take part in phases, with cash prizes awarded in each phase:</p>\n<ul> <li>Phase 1, beginning in Fall of 2019, seeks proposals from competitors who aim to innovate and tailor the pipeline models to include individuals with IDD.</li> <li>Phase 2, beginning in Spring of 2020, participants will be asked to conduct small scale feasibility testing on the selected workforce pipeline models.&nbsp; Teams will convene in Washington, D.C. to propose their ideas to a panel of judges who will help select winners.&nbsp; Judges will have expertise in increasing access into the labor force for people with disabilities.</li> <li>Phase 3, beginning in Summer 2020, will examine the replicability, scalability, and long-term sustainability. Teams will again convene in Washington, DC, and the Grand Prize winner will be announced in October of 2020..&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>\n<p>ACL is looking for innovative workforce pipelines that:</p>\n<ul> <li>Serve people with a wide range of disabilities, including individuals with IDD;</li> <li>Redefine career development requirements and pathways using non-traditional methods;</li> <li>Innovate and incorporate pipeline components that specifically address the employment barriers for the IDD community;</li> <li>Include individuals from the IDD community throughout the development and testing of models;</li> <li>Include a business commitment to implement the model for Phase 2 (small scale testing) of the challenge; and</li> <li>Lead to competitive, integrated employment.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p>\n<p>A challenge (also referred to as \"prize challenge,&rdquo; \"competition,\" \"prize competition,\" \"incentive prize\" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>\n<ol> <li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li> <li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li> <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li> </ol>\n<p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>\n<p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>\n<ul> <li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li> <li>Reach wide communities of experts</li> <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li> <li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li> <li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li> </ul>\n<p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/\">https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/</a></u></p>\n<p><strong><u>Today&rsquo;s Workforce for Americans with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</u></strong></p>\n<p>With the nation&rsquo;s strong economic growth and historically low unemployment rates, America&rsquo;s business leaders are actively searching for diverse and talented workers to build an inclusive and dynamic national workforce.&nbsp; Despite the more than seven million unfilled jobs, unemployment among Americans with disabilities remains above 70%.&nbsp; For Americans with intellectual and developmental disabilities, the number is even greater with 82% remaining out of the workforce.&nbsp; For individuals with IDD who are employed, data consistently show that the majority work part-time in entry-level positions, have low income, and have limited access to employee benefits.&nbsp; In addition to these gaps, many career tracks are often not accessible to the IDD community because of requirements such as completion of higher education or having a driver&rsquo;s license; many of these requirements are not necessary to succeed.</p>\n<p>In today&rsquo;s thriving and competitive market, businesses across the United States are providing innovative and competitive opportunities to workers to develop new skills and enter into career-tracked jobs.&nbsp; From apprenticeships and training programs, to leadership rotational programs, and integrative internships, employers are developing pipelines for recruiting and retaining talent.&nbsp; Paired against the deep bench of talent from the population of Americans with disabilities, there is current opportunity to develop and expand employment recruitment and workforce pipeline programs to target, train, and retain the talents of workers with disabilities, including those with IDD.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Opportunity to Modernize Employment Recruitment, Training, and Retention for Americans with Disabilities</u></strong></p>\n<p>How does a company pave the way in the area of disability employment and inclusion?&nbsp; Most success stories showcase companies who bring creativity and innovation to the process of recruitment and training for hiring and retaining people with disabilities.<sup>1</sup> One example includes how technology firms have examined the initial barrier to why people with autism were not getting placed in jobs, and at least one is now partnering with a local company to bring in qualified candidates for a week-long academy of training and technical exercises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there are effective ways of building the pipeline to employment for people with disabilities, current best practices in workforce recruitment and training for individuals with IDD require some innovative components such as spending time with individuals in community settings, working with families, and negotiating job responsibilities with an employer.</p>\n<ol> <li>American Association of People with Disabilities &amp; Disability:IN (2018).

            "description": "<p>The Safeguard with Autonomous Navigation Demonstration (SAND) Challenge will be an opportunity for small businesses to compete in an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle competition. The challenge will address some of the safety critical risks associated with flying UAVs in the National Airspace system (NAS):&nbsp; 1) flight outside of approved airspace and 2) unsafe Proximity to people or property.</p>\n<p>Beyond visual line of sight operations (BVLOS) is the holy grail of UAV operations. The stretch goal of the SAND challenge is to demonstrate that UAVs integrated with NASA Langley’s patented geo-fencing technology, Safeguard, can operate safely beyond visual line of sight in the NAS. NASA Langley’s patented Safeguard technology is designed to assuredly address the aforementioned safety critical risks and will fly onboard the competitor’s vehicle while navigating the competition course. Safeguard is NASA’s patented aviation quality geo-fencing technology. Safeguard is a verified and validated independent system that uses real-time data about the position of a UAV to determine its proximity to a set of pre-defined and pre-loaded lateral boundaries and an altitude limit.</p>\n<p>The SAND Challenge will demonstrate the successful integration of the NASA Safeguard technology in the context of a post-natural disaster scenario amidst critical infrastructure. The SAND Challenge will be held in May of 2020 in Hampton, Virginia.</p>\n<p>The primary objectives of the SAND Challenge are:</p>\n<ul> <li>To demonstrate safe operations of autonomous UAVs amidst critical infrastructure in a simulated post-natural disaster scenario using NASA Langley’s Safeguard Technology to stakeholders, the emerging UAV industry, and the public.</li> <li>To collect post competition data from Safeguard for further analysis that may inspire new regulatory policies that support expanded use of commercial UAV systems.</li> <li>To inform regulatory stakeholders including federal, state, and local governments on the potential operational benefits of integrating NASA Langley’s Safeguard Technology to UAVs to aid first responders in natural disasters events.</li> <li>To engage the emerging UAV operator market to the value proposition of NASA Langley’s Safeguard Technology and its potential use cases for commercialization and licensing.</li> </ul>\n<p>The small business competitors will develop their own autonomous logic implemented on their drones to provide surveillance and identification of key targets in a simulated post-natural disaster scene. A preliminary description of the SAND Competition Course will be provided on the SAND Demonstration website by October 15, 2019. The NASA Langley patented Safeguard technology will be flown as a stand-alone payload mounted on the drone. Details on the integration of the Safeguard technology can be found in Safeguard/SMART-04-002 Interface Control Document for Safeguard Units on the SAND2020 website which will be posted on the website by October, 15 2019.</p>\n<p><strong>Please visit <a href=\"http://sand2020.nianet.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sand2020.nianet.org</a> for key dates, official rules and requirements, judging criteria, and instructions on how to enter.</strong></p>\n",

            "description": "<h3>UPDATE:&nbsp; The WNS Challenge winner announcement is postponed until further notice. Stay tuned for more information and thank you for your support!</h3>\n<p>Hibernating bats in North America are in trouble. An invasive fungus, <em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em>, that causes a disease called white-nose syndrome is spreading across the continent and killing millions of bats. Bats eat insects and are integral to thriving ecosystems. With the loss of millions of bats because of this deadly fungus, many millions more forest and agriculture insect pests are left to feed on trees and crops, ultimately affecting the balance of nature and even human health.</p>\n<p>There is no known cure for white-nose syndrome, but scientists from all over the world are working together to study the disease, how it spreads and infects bats and what we can do to control it. Much of this work has been done under the umbrella of the United States’ National Response to White-nose Syndrome, a broad, multi-agency effort led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Bat-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bat affected by white-nose syndrome\" /></p>\n<p>The White-nose Syndrome Prize Challenge seeks ideas that may lead to a permanent solution to this crisis of wildlife health by eliminating, weakening, or disarming the fungus that causes it.</p>\n<p>The White-nose Syndrome Challenge specifically seeks ideas that can permanently eliminate, disarm, or weaken <em>P. destructans</em> in the wild. Through the challenge, we invite ideas that can lead to solutions to reduce the effects of the fungus without harming other beneficial species or the environment. We are seeking ideas that can be employed in the field in the near future and benefit many of the affected species across their ranges.</p>\n<p>Ideas recognized through this Challenge will be the focus of future collaborations to establish an appropriate research and development plan to bring the envisioned tools to fruition. Experts in relevant fields, including members of winning teams, if appropriate, will come together to identify critical research and technology needs to develop the solution.</p>\n<p>After that, qualified scientists, designers and engineers will have an opportunity to apply to do this work and develop prospective tools for use. Once ready, we hope the tool(s)will be used throughout the country to improve survival of bats susceptible to white-nose syndrome.</p>\n<p>A webinar for interested solvers will be held on November 20, 2-3 p.m. ET.

            "description": "<p>In June 2017, the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) put on the first Agile Robotics for Industrial Applications Competition (ARIAC). The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers. For the second and third year of the competition, we introduced a cash prize to motivate and expand participation. This is the fourth year of the competition.</p>\n<p>In this context, agility is defined broadly to address:</p>\n<ul> <li>Failure identification and recovery, where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically recover from those failures</li> <li>Automated planning, to minimize (or eliminate) the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li> <li>Fixtureless environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts that are not in predefined locations</li> </ul>\n<p>The competition Participants are required to develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot in a simulated environment. Gazebo (gazebosim.com), which is an open source robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing platform and the Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software libraries and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.</p>\n<p>Software interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants to control the robot.  The qualifier will begin in the April 2020 timeframe with the final competition occurring in mid-May 2020. The competition will be performed virtually, so physical attendance is not required to compete. NIST is intends to propose a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow the winning Participants to present their approaches; details, when available, will be posted to the official challenge website.</p>\n<h4>Dates of the Competition:</h4>\n<ul> <li>Accepting Qualifier Submissions Through:&nbsp; April 3, 2020</li> <li>Qualifier Begin:&nbsp; April 6, 2020</li> <li>Qualifier End:&nbsp; April 10, 2020</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Begins:&nbsp; May 11, 2020</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Ends:&nbsp; 5:00 PM, EDT (UTC-05:00), May 15, 2020</li> <li>Announcement of Cash Prize Winners:&nbsp; late May 2020</li> </ul>\n",

            "judging": "<h4>Judging Panel</h4>\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>\n<h4>Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</h4>\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant's final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\n<h4>Cost Metrics</h4>\n<p>The following values are calculated for a Participant’s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials.</p>\n<p>The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The final cost for individual sensors will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the Finals. For planning purposes, Participants should use:&nbsp; </p>\n<ul> <li>$500 for each logical camera used.</li> <li>$100 for each other sensor used (e.g., break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li> </ul>\n<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be compared to the average of all the team costs and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as TC, and the average team cost is designated as AC. There is also a factor (m) for the cost factor to magnify the difference between the cost factors of each team, which is initially set at a value of 3. The final m value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals. The cost factor, is then calculated as:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/cost-metric-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cost metric equation\" /></p>\n<h4>Completion Score</h4>\n<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the box. The completion score, CS, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the box. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the box and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order kj with i products in it would have a maximum score of:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/completion-score-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"completion score equation\" /></p>\n<h4>Efficiency Factor</h4>\n<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first kit is completed and is designated as T01. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, Ti is counted in seconds from the time that the ith order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times for each team (ATi) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/efficiency-factor-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"efficiency factor equation\" /></p>\n<p>If a team’s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.</p>\n<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, h, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final h value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>\n<h4>Trial Score Calculation</h4>\n<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/trial-score-calculation1-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"scoring equation for each trial\" /></p>\n<p>For the trials where there is no second, higher priority, order, the following modifications are used:&nbsp; CSK2 = CSK1 , EF2 = 0. This results in the simplified scoring equation:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/trial-score-calculation2-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"modified scoring for each trial\" /></p>\n<h4>Final Score Calculation</h4>\n<p>The final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Kit Building, Dropped Part, and In-Process Kit Change scenarios, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Winners:&nbsp; </strong>The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Judging Criteria</h4>\n<ul> <li><strong>Overall Performance based on the scoring metrics described above (80 points). </strong>Using the scoring metrics described herein, the first-place entry will be award 80 points, the second-place entry will be award 70 points, the third place entry will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li> <li><strong>Novelty of approach and alignment with spirit of competition (20 points). </strong>At the judges’ sole discretion, up to 20 points will be awarded for entries that show novel approaches to solving the agility challenges and whose approaches are consistent with the spirit of the competition of coming up with industrially-implementable approaches that will help industry make better use of their robotic platforms. Each entry is eligible for up to 20 points, and more than one entry can receive all 20 points (or any other value). </li> </ul>\n<p>NIST will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists that have been awarded a cash award (each, an \"Award\"). The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST's sole discretion. Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>\n<p>The winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as \"undeliverable\" will result in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified in the winning entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an entry through that representative. The list of entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>\n<p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>\n<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition entries are to be borne by Participants.</p>\n",
            "how-to-enter": "<p>An interested Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering at the ARIAC website. The party is then given access to view the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants will be notified by email.</p>\n<p>Once registered, the Participants are eligible to participate in the qualifier. The qualifier will occur in the April 2020 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants must complete the qualifier to be eligible to compete in the final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifier to be eligible for the final competition.</p>\n<p>Participants will run the qualifier from their own location. They will have two weeks from the date that the qualifier is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants will be emailed when the qualifier is released. They should run the qualifier at their own location and submit the resulting output files generated by their control system (listed below). Their output files should be uploaded to an account (nfiles.nist.gov) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant.</p>\n<p>Specific files that need to be submitted include:</p>\n<ul> <li>Their environment configuration file specifying your choice of sensors.</li> <li>A performance log file that contains information about the task completion.</li> <li>A simulation state log file that contains information about the state of Gazebo during the trial.</li> </ul>\n<h3>Competition Scenarios</h3>\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document:</p>\n<ul> <li>Order:&nbsp; A list of parts and their goal location on a tray.</li> <li>Part:&nbsp; One element of an order.</li> <li>Tray:&nbsp; A surface that hold parts.</li> <li>Kit:&nbsp; A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li> </ul>\n<p>ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>\n<p>There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Scenario 1:&nbsp; Baseline Kit Building:&nbsp; </strong>The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will receive an “Order” that details the list of parts and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</li> <li><strong>Scenario 2:&nbsp; Dropped Part:&nbsp; </strong>The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots’ gripper. The robots will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</li> <li>Scenario 3:&nbsp; In-Process Kit Change:&nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;While the robots are in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</li> </ul>\n<h3>Fifteen Trials</h3>\n<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials:&nbsp; 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\n<h4>Robot Arm</h4>\n<ul> <li>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal Robots UR10.</li> <li>The robot arms’ position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted.</li> <li>The end of the arms are equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</li> </ul>\n<h4>Sensors</h4>\n<p>A Participant can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score. A sample of available sensors may include:</p>\n<ol> <li>Break beam:&nbsp; reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li> <li>Laser scanner:&nbsp; provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li> <li>Cognex logical camera:&nbsp; provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li> <li>Proximity:&nbsp; detects the range to an object.</li> </ol>\n<h4>Order</h4>\n<p>An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete. Each order will specify the kit to be assembled, (i.e. the list of parts to be put in the kit). Each specified part has the following structure:</p>\n<ul> <li>The type of part.</li> <li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li> </ul>\n<h4>Faulty parts</h4>\n<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts:&nbsp; they will not count for any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts bonus if left in trays.</p>\n<h4>Competition process</h4>\n<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\n<ul> <li>The robots programmatically signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li> <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li> <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li> <li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method, up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li> <li>In the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li> <li>The robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality control.</li> <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li> </ul>\n"

If the tool is effective, it could be added to the Employment Workshop curriculum for all transitioning service members.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) began a cross-agency effort to understand the transition of a Service member from active duty to civilian employment, from the perspective of the individual navigating this process—not the perspective of the Federal organizations that exist to support a plethora of programs. <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/mapping-cx-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The agencies built a journeymap of this process and found a recurring theme:&nbsp; navigating the “sea of support” and resources relating to the job search can be a challenging task.</a></p>\n<p><img style=\"width:500px; float:right;\" src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Vets-Employment-Challenge-sealsV1.jpg\" alt=\"Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Department of Defense seals\" /></p>\n<p>Veterans complete their military service with unique and technical skillsets that bring value to all sectors of the economy, but can encounter challenges framing their experience and skills for civilian employers. American businesses report that they are also missing an opportunity to attract and retain a capable, competent workforce, and recognize the value in veterans and spouses.</p>\n<p>Many job boards, veteran hiring programs, and other initiatives exist, but there are disparate platforms of valuable data. Traversing across these resources can be overwhelming for both first-time job-seeking veterans and businesses with limited time to fill urgent needs. Additionally, most job search tools for Service members are based purely on military occupational specialties, which do not accurately represent the breadth of experiences many individuals have. Finally, small businesses in particular do not have the staff capacity to build out robust skills profiles that better describe hiring needs.</p>\n<p>There is a need for both a more sophisticated matching mechanism and a simpler interface that can pull from existing data sources (from Federal platforms like <a href=\"https://www.onetonline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">O*NET</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.militaryonesource.mil/military-life-cycle/separation-transition/employment-education/credentialing-your-military-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) program</a>, and the <a href=\"https://veterans.usnlx.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Labor Exchange</a>, to LinkedIn profiles, resumes, or job descriptions that individuals and businesses have created).</p>\n<p>The Government wants to be mindful of not prescribing what the platform should look like or how it will work, but wanted to note some of what job-seekers and Federal employees have shared throughout the research process of designing this competition. In particular, the agencies heard a need for:</p>\n<ul> <li>A matching-oriented application for the job-searching process. A platform that could determine likeness of fit, reveal matches, and allow both the employers and job-seekers to opt-in and share more information with each other and potentially interact more (connecting with Veterans at the company, chatting, etc.).</li> <li>A platform that has functions like a “ZocDoc” for job searching. Employers can self-input information (like doctors input their location, office hours, and information about their practice), external reviews from users are included, and users can actually take an action (book an appointment) in one place.</li> <li>A one-stop-shop verification system of employers. Employers on the platform could be matched automatically with databases that note if they are Federal contractors, have earned a <a href=\"https://www.hirevets.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HIRE Vets Medallion</a>, or display information to help form a profile indicating whether the employer is who it claims to be (e.g., Google/Glassdoor/Yelp/Better Business Bureau/etc.).</li> </ul>\n<p>This competition is divided into phases that will enable Solvers to further engage users in their design process and gather feedback on working prototypes. The most important requirement of this competition is that the platform solves challenges faced by the actual users, understanding what’s most useful and helpful to them, rather than being tool-led.</p>\n<p>Here is some of what we heard about the gap that exists:</p>\n<h4>Job-Seeker Needs</h4>\n<ul> <li>Ability to filter opportunities that match skillsets based on personally important components such as benefits offered, location, and culture.</li> <li>Recommendations of opportunities outside occupational analysis, if necessary, to describe the skills and role in a familiar manner that Service members better understand.</li> <li>Confidence in individual privacy and data protections at the highest standard.</li> <li>Ability to “Turn on / Turn off” when you’re looking for opportunities.</li> <li>Ability to control what information is shared with employers of potentially “matched” opportunities (e.g., if you match with an opportunity, what level of information is shown to an employer to either contact you or learn more about you).</li> <li>Ability to take an action directly (such as API to apply for a job or contact an employer)—minimizing the need to update multiple platforms or re-enter data multiple times.</li> <li>Ability to connect with other veterans at a specific company.</li> <li>Ability to easily remove a particular profile and all related data from the platform.</li> </ul>\n<h4>Employer Needs</h4>\n<ul> <li>Present themselves—in particular, small business with limited HR capacities—through a profile that contains standardized information, as well as information about the organization.</li> <li>Post specific available opportunities in a manner that is designed to address service member and veteran-specific priorities, including:&nbsp; position descriptions, required skillsets, benefits, and work environment (e.g., support for Veterans, training, onboarding, mentorship opportunities). This could include options to connect a job-seeker directly to veterans currently employed at the company.</li> <li>Generate “match lists” of qualified candidates.</li> <li>Provide technology-enabled solutions to allow for direct outreach to candidates through mechanisms they regularly check (existing email accounts, text messages) rather than a separate message management system that requires additional login (only if candidates have set their profiles to allow for direct contact).</li> </ul>\n<h4>Federal Government Needs</h4>\n<ul> <li>Access to a feedback loop to learn more about matches made, types of users, most useful feature, and other raw data to inform Federal program efforts and ultimately track outcomes, including employment that is initiated beyond 180 days, wage rates, and/or retention statistics.</li> <li>Ability to fold in/link to existing government data efforts when they reach maturity.</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>Update:</strong> NIDA understands that the emergency declaration related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) will adversely affect many Challenge applicants' ability to submit applications in a timely manner.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Challenge applications will be accepted through May 26, 2020. New dates for the judging period and winners announcement are also reflected under \"Dates\" in this section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the 5th “$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>\n<p>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA scientific research entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p>\n<h3><strong>Subject of the Challenge</strong></h3>\n<p>NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its dependable success and popularity within the community from 2016 to 2019. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas that would further an understanding of SUD and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful startups. NIDA offers $100,000 together with the technical expertise and mentoring from scientific research entrepreneurship experts and expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide the prize money and scientific research-based entrepreneurial assistance to the “would be” startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g. small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that, eventually, the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>\n<p>What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adjusted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating the startup around their research idea. The research “idea” is the product that the future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to an underserved customer.</p>\n<p>The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation, within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dates</strong></h3>\n<ul> <li>The Challenge begins January 2, 2020.</li> <li>Submission Period:&nbsp; 9 a.m. ET, January 21, 2020 to May 26, 2020, 5:00 p.m. ET.</li> <li>Judging Period:&nbsp; May 27, 2020 to June 15, 2020.</li> <li>Winners Announced:&nbsp; June 22, 2020.</li> </ul>\n<h4><strong>For further information, contact:</strong></h4>\n<p>Elena Koustova, PhD, MBA, Director, Office of Translational Initiatives and Program Innovations (OTIPI), NIDA Challenge Manager, National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), 6001 Executive Blvd Room 4206, MSC 9555 Bethesda, MD 20892-9555.

            "how-to-enter": "<p>To enter the Challenge, participants must complete the <a href=\"https://htnchampions.millionhearts.hhs.gov/\">application form</a> on the Million Hearts® site. The application form is a combination of short answer responses, checkbox responses, and assurances.</p>\n\n<p>Application information includes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The size of the applicant’s adult patient population defined as the number of adult patients (age 18 years and older) served during the reporting year regardless of diagnosis, a summary of known patient demographics (e.g., age distribution), and any noteworthy patient population characteristics. The reporting year (continuous 12 months) should reflect the most currently available data.</li>\n  <li>The percent of the applicant’s adult patient population identified above that were seen during the reporting year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence). There are an estimated 14 million people who are unaware of their hypertension. Most of these people are hiding in plain sight—they are in clinical treatment with elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension neither diagnosed nor treated. Applicants selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension prevalence (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the condition) assessed for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence. Initially, a rough estimate of the applicant’s predicted hypertension prevalence will be calculated using the reported age distribution of their patient population and hypertension prevalence findings from national studies, using the <a href=\"http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/files/MH_HTN_Estimator.xlsm\">Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool [Excel-88K]</a>. If the applicant’s reported prevalence varies considerably from this rough estimate, the applicant may be asked to describe possible reasons for this disparity during the data validation process. If the reported hypertension prevalence is extreme and there is not a justifiable reason, the applicant may be excluded from further participation in the Challenge.</li>\n  <li>The hypertension control rate should be for the provider’s or health system’s entire adult hypertensive population identified above during the reporting year. The provider’s or health system’s hypertensive population ages 18-85 should include only patients in primary care or in cardiology care in the case of a cardiology clinic. Patients seen only in dental care or behavioral health care should not be included. Examples of ineligible data submissions include hypertension control rates that are limited to treatment cohorts from research studies or pilot studies, patients limited to a specific age range (such as 18-35), or patients enrolled in limited scale quality improvement projects.  </li>\n  <li>In addition, the hypertension control rate during the previous reporting year is also required. For example, if the current reporting year is January 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019, then the previous reporting year should be January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018.</li>\n  <li>In determining the hypertension control rate, CDC defines “hypertension control” as a blood pressure reading &lt;140 mmHg systolic and &lt;90 mmHg diastolic among adult hypertensive patients ages 18-85.</li>\n  <li>A description of clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control. Checkbox responses may be supplemented by a short answer response. Supporting information about clinic systems is encouraged but not required. Sustainable systems may include provider or patient incentives, dashboards, staffing characteristics, electronic record keeping systems, reminder or alert systems, clinician reporting, service modifications, etc.</li>\n  <li>The applicant must agree to:\n    <ul>\n      <li>Participate in a data validation process, accept the award if selected, and participate in award activities.</li>\n      <li>To complete, without revisions, a required Business Associate Agreement form and/or other forms that may be required by applicable law.</li>\n      <li>Participate in a 60-minute interview or similar activity to gather information about their hypertension control strategies, and work with CDC on the review of material to share clinical strategies. Strategies used by Champions that support hypertension control may be written into a success story, placed on this website, and attributed to Champions.</li>\n      <li>Assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue or profits, whether direct, indirect or consequences, arising from participation in this prize contest, whether the injury, death, damage or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</li>\n      <li>Indemnify the federal government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to competition activities.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Applicants not agreeing to each of these items on the application form will be excluded from the Challenge.<br />\nPaper responses will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>The estimated burden for completing the application form is 30 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Applicants not agreeing to each of these items on the application form will be excluded from the Challenge.<br />\nPaper responses will not be accepted.</p>\n\n<p>The estimated burden for completing the application form is 30 minutes.</p>\n"

The result of the First Responder UAS Endurance Challenge will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep a UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders on the ground while they conduct their mission. The advancement of UAS research achieved through this challenge will help support the development and operation of UAS that are intended to host critical tools for public safety missions, such as wireless communications systems.</p>\n\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is hosting a 4-stage challenge, with prize awards <strong>up to $552,000</strong> for the top designs. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage. The most outstanding Stage 1 conceptual designs will be eligible to participate in the remaining stages of the competition (<a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/updated-official-rules-pscr-first-responder-uas-endurance-challenge-august2020.pdf\">see Official Rules</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>You can make a difference!</strong> Continue reading to learn about challenge stages and details.

PSCR’s Open Innovation team engages public safety entities, government, academia, and industry to identify innovation opportunities and foster technology advancements for public safety communications through prize competitions and challenges.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"project-objectives\">Project Objectives</h4>\n\n<p>The purpose of this Challenge is to advance UAS technologies by building and flying drones designed to support first responders. One of the barriers for the public safety community is having access to drones that can fly for long periods of time, ninety minutes or greater, while carrying a heavy payload. Emergency responders can accomplish their mission more efficiently and effectively if the drone flight time for a known payload is maximized. Since the payload capacity, energy source, flight characteristics, and flight time are linked together through design trade-offs, PSCR is exploring ways to optimize drones for increased flight endurance while making it more efficient and flexible for use by public safety.</p>\n\n<p>In pursuit of that goal, PSCR is investigating options to enable state and local first responders the ability to deploy drones for law enforcement, firefighting, and other emergency services needing broadband connectivity and services. In a typical search-and-rescue scenario, a team of one or two first responders may be dispatched to a location where broadband LTE communications are unavailable. To maintain communications, first responders might deploy an LTE system using a drone to provide communications to first responders on the ground and extend coverage to an area that is remote from where the drone initially launched. Some key features and capabilities of interest to public safety include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The drone and supporting system equipment can be stored in the cargo space of an SUV or pickup truck.</li>\n  <li>The drone should be light in weight (one-person setup), easy to set up, capable of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) and not require special tools.</li>\n  <li>The drone may be required to move between different locations in order to maintain communications coverage.</li>\n  <li>The drone needs to continuously fly as long as possible, be easily recovered, stored and readied for the next mission.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PSCR is aware that various organizations have, or are developing, drones with higher payload capacities and long endurance; however, these drones typically cost more than what a local public safety department might be able to afford. Additionally, they may not be practical due to the difficulty of transporting large equipment and/or the need for specialized training to operate it, both of which can be difficult for city/state agencies with limited staff and resources. Therefore, PSCR is hosting this 4-stage challenge to design, develop, and demonstrate drones with extended flight time and other capabilities that support first responders to help advance the research and push the boundaries of UAS technology for public safety.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"deliverables-due\">Deliverables Due</h4>\n\n<p>Participants will be asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a concept paper using an online form, outlining the UAS knowledge, skills, capabilities and design approach for this challenge</li>\n  <li>Create or purchase hardware necessary to build a prototype and implement the design approach outlined within the concept paper</li>\n  <li>Produce a Test flight video demonstrating the UAS prototype capabilities and safety compliance</li>\n  <li>Participate in a 5-day Live Competition demonstrating full capabilities and features of the UAS prototype</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"uas-challenge-stages\">UAS Challenge Stages</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/uas-challenge-table-b.jpg\" alt=\"Challenge Stages\" title=\"UAS Challenge Stages\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"prizes\">Prizes</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"total-cash-prize-pool\">Total Cash Prize Pool</h4>\n\n<p>Up to $552,000</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"prize-breakdown\">Prize Breakdown</h4>\n\n<p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research program is hosting a 4-stage challenge, with development funds, travel, and prize awards listed in the following table:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/uas-challenge-table-c.jpg\" alt=\"Prize Breakdown\" title=\"Prize Breakdown\" /></p>\n\n<p>NOTE: This table only describes prize awards; additional contestants may be invited to participate in challenge stages but not receive prize awards.

The goal of the challenge is to foster innovation in computational analysis and machine learning approaches utilizing large-scale NHLBI-funded datasets to identify new paradigms in heart failure research. The challenge aims to address the need for new open source disease models that can define sub-categorizations of adult heart failure to serve as a springboard for new research hypotheses and tool development in areas of heart failure research from basic to clinical settings.</p>\n<p>Adult heart failure is a chronic, progressive disorder in which the heart is unable to efficiently pump blood, and more than 6.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. It is currently often categorized by a single metric – left ventricular ejection fraction – but is known to be a multi-organ, systemic syndrome with many related but seemingly disparate phenotypes. Additionally, social, behavioral, environmental, and genetic determinants often captured in study data have a considerable influence on outcome but are not well-understood. The field of heart failure research currently lacks a systematic framework that incorporates these many factors in a comprehensive disease model. An adult heart failure sub-phenotyping scheme incorporating many disease-associated factors would provide a new paradigm that will benefit investigations into the mechanism of disease, diagnosis, and, ultimately, prevention and treatment.</p>\n<p>The NHLBI seeks to foster such paradigm shifts in heart failure research by awarding innovative Solutions that utilize existing large health datasets. NHLBI has a history of making considerable investments in the creation of deep data resources including:&nbsp; long-standing, deeply-phenotyped <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/population-and-epidemiology-studies\" target=\"_blank\">epidemiological cohorts</a>, innovative <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/clinical-trials/nhlbi-clinical-trials\" target=\"_blank\">clinical trials</a>, and large-scale <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/precision-medicine-activities\" target=\"_blank\">precision medicine</a> efforts that have generated whole genome sequencing and “other omics” data for more than one-hundred thousand individuals. Many of these and other data are publicly accessible via the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/\" target=\"_blank\">dbGaP</a>) and the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (<a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/\" target=\"_blank\">BioLINCC</a>). The NHLBI Heart Failure Big Data Analysis Challenge webpage, <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge</a>, provides further details about available open- and controlled-access NHLBI-funded datasets and data access resources.</p>\n<p>With these datasets in hand, the NHLBI is seeking to promote the application of computational analysis and machine learning approaches to create opportunities for hypothesis generation and research tool development for heart failure research. This challenge aims to reward innovative, computational Solutions utilizing large health datasets to develop a schema for the sub-phenotyping of adult heart failure that facilitates basic and/or clinical heart failure research objectives. A successful adult heart failure sub-phenotyping Solution will be a novel, pragmatic, accessible research tool for a spectrum of heart failure researchers. Successful Solutions will also be free and openly available to the research community. Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of NHLBI-funded datasets in the development of their Solution and are also welcome to bring other relevant data to their analyses.</p>\n",

            "judging": "<p>The Challenge evaluation will focus on AI/ML technologies that detect adversarial campaigns via network observable behaviors or by analysis of data collected across an enterprise.</p>\n<p>The following describes the network being defended in this Challenge:</p>\n<ul> <li>An enterprise network with a relatively flat architecture of maximum 1,500 endpoints.</li> <li>All north/south and east/west traffic is observable with a mixture of encrypted and unencrypted traffic. Traffic decryption is not provided.</li> <li>Network services include (minimally) a Firewall, Active Directory, Domain Name Service, and Dynamic Addressing (DHCP), and the network data will contain traffic from these services.</li> <li>Enterprise endpoint defense is a commercial, enterprise-grade endpoint security service product, offering host protection. The candidate product will not receive information directly from or rely upon the host endpoint security service.</li> <li>The environment will have a SIEM, potentially with relevant service logs and endpoint logs that will be available for query.</li> <li>Specific data and formats will be shared at the time of technology installation and configuration (see Challenge Timeline &amp; Evaluation Process).</li> </ul>\n<p>The following describes the scope of the candidate technologies:</p>\n<ul> <li>This evaluation is focused on detecting adversarial campaigns against a small/medium enterprise network using network observable data and events, with normal proportions of encrypted and unencrypted content.</li> <li>Endpoint detection and protection tools (such as anti-virus or host-based malware detectors), source code analyzers, reverse engineering frameworks, or operations automation frameworks are not eligible.</li> <li>Technologies will be provided a passive tap for the enterprise network, and an ability to interact with the SIEM.</li> <li>Technologies will analyze raw network data streams to determine the presence of an adversarial campaign or individual attack events.</li> <li>Technologies will generate network alerts, ingestible by the SIEM and using an alert format compatible with common SIEMs (e.g. Splunk).</li> <li>Technologies are expected to have an artificial intelligence and/or machine learning component and can also include other complementary approaches, such as signature- or rule-based detection.</li> <li>To measure how AI/ML improves adversarial campaign detection, the test data will use commercially available and custom developed campaigns using various exploitation frameworks.</li> <li>For each adversarial campaign, the range and associated analytic technologies will be reset to a known state.</li> <li>Technologies that leverage learning online or from historical data will be provided three weeks of ambient network data to form their models.</li> <li>Technologies that rely on learning online or from historical data must provide the capability to snapshot, or save, and then reload a built model.</li> <li>Technologies must operate completely on-premises. There will be no external connectivity available during the Challenge. Technologies that require an external/cloud connection will be disqualified.</li> <li>Technologies are expected to provide visibility into their resource usage and computational performance in an easily accessible manner.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation environment will be the Cybersecurity Operations Research Range (CORR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Submitted technologies must include documentation necessary for installation and configuration, and also an evaluation license that covers minimally the following conditions:</p>\n<ul> <li>A trial period through December 2020,</li> <li>A maximum 10 Gb/s supported network data rate, and/or</li> <li>Supporting traffic from a network up to 1,500 nodes in size.</li> </ul>\n<p>The software and/or hardware components for the on-premises console must be one of the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>Exported Virtual Machine Image (e.g., .ova, .qcow2, etc.) that can be run with a libvirt-compatible hypervisor (e.g. QEMU, XenServer, VMWare, Virtualbox, Emulab, etc.)</li> <li>Docker container package</li> <li><em>Standalone&nbsp;</em>hardware appliance that&nbsp;<strong><em><u>will not</u></em></strong><em> be&nbsp;</em>connected to external cloud services</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Challenge Evaluation Process</strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation process will include four major steps once submissions are received.</p>\n<ol> <li><strong>White Paper Analysis.</strong> ORNL&rsquo;s team with consultation of NAVWAR will review the submission of white papers to determine eligibility and down select to a subset of the technologies to be evaluated.</li> <li><strong>Technology Installation and Configuration.</strong> For those submissions remaining, the evaluation team will attempt to install and configure each technology in the range environment, in order to assure communication with the range data interfaces and tune each technology&rsquo;s configuration. A maximum two-day on-site support by the submitting organization may be required to optimize the configuration. At the conclusion of the Installation and Configuration stage, the technology configuration will be locked.</li> <li><strong>Training &amp; Tuning:</strong> The generation of ambient data for ML model training will happen once the range configuration is locked. Each technology will be exposed to approximately three weeks of traffic for ML model generation.</li> <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The actual test evaluation process of the tool will involve levying multiple adversarial campaigns against the enterprise, with increasing complexity and realism. Technologies will be evaluated on their ability to detect elements of each campaign as it progresses. Resource information (CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O) associated with the operation of the technology will be collected during each test within the evaluation.</li> </ol>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<p>This challenge seeks to test how much of an adversarial campaign (sequence of events towards an exploitative goal) the candidate technologies can uncover. The score will be in terms of a cost estimate that simulates the cost to an enterprise using this technology for a given period of time. The cost estimate will sum simulated attack costs, labor costs, and resource costs.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Simulated attack cost:</strong>&nbsp;Estimated costs resulting from each campaign&rsquo;s malicious events will be a function representing attack costs over time. This simulates costs of lost or corrupted data, ransoms, etc. The attack cost function is increasing in time and in steps of the attack kill chain, such that early detection will accrue less cost than later (or no) detection. Simulated attack cost is only accrued for a true positive (alerting on a malicious event) until time of detection, and for a false negative (no alert on a malicious event) resulting in a maximum attack cost.</li> <li><strong>Simulated security operator cost:</strong>&nbsp;Estimated SOC costs, based on actual labor rates of security operators, will be computed for initial setup and ongoing use of the technology. For each alert issued by the technology, labor costs for triage, investigation, and incident response will be incurred. Ongoing security operator costs are incurred for both true positives (alerting on malicious events), and false positives (alerting on benign events).</li> <li><strong>Simulated</strong> <strong>resource cost:&nbsp;</strong>Estimated resource costs for initial setup and ongoing use of the technology will be based on rates from recent research. Ongoing resources that will be monitored and incorporated may include but are not limited to usage of CPU, volatile memory, disk I/O, network I/O.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>THE WINNERS OF THE CHALLENGE WILL BE THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE LOWEST COMPUTED TOTAL COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCORING ABOVE.</strong></p>\n",

One disease must be sickle cell, malaria, and / or anemia. Proposals will only be accepted if they describe a way to extend to two diseases on a single platform. Full points require in vivo target accuracy in representative background populations for two diseases, though scoring will be scaled appropriately.</li> <li><strong>Analytic performance. </strong>Proposed device must be relevant for clinical decision-making, with results that are comparable to or improve upon standard practice at a peripheral care setting. The device must have comparable analytic sensitivity and specificity to existing tests. The device should be able to incorporate dynamic personal and population priors (e.g. medical history or disease prevalence, respectively) to improve the accuracy of the test result in clinical settings.</li> <ul> <li>For anemia, in comparison to the reference method, 85% of the results must fall within +1.0g Hb/dL of the reference across a range of Hb concentrations spanning the healthy range and moderate to severe anemia.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Clinical utility. </strong>Device must be able to differentiate between relevant strains of the disease, across necessary population age brackets, and over the course of disease progression.</li> <ul> <li>For <strong>sickle cell</strong>, the device needs to differentiate sickle cell as early in life as possible, in conjunction with dynamic priors. Ideally, the device should be able to perform with high levels of fetal hemoglobin still present and should be able to differentiate sickle cell disease from sickle cell trait.</li> <li>For <strong>malaria</strong>, the device needs to be able to detect and differentiate various parasite species. Required are Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and / or Plasmodium vivax (Pv); Optimal is all Plasmodium species. If all species cannot be differentiated, differentiation between Pf  and Pv is desired.</li> <li>An <strong>anemia</strong> diagnostic must clinically differentiate mild, moderate and severe anemia. In addition, it must have 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity in each trimester of pregnancy at the moderate anemia threshold of 11.0g/dL and the severe anemia threshold point of 7.0g/dL.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Detection and interpretation. </strong>Proposed device should measure parameters that could be used to track disease state and/or response to therapy. Results from a test must be interpretable by a machine.</li> <li><strong>Safety. </strong>If used, light sources should be Class 2 or Class 3R with appropriate controls to avoid eye exposure or skin damage.

Further, in light of <u><a href=\"https://2020census.gov/en/news-events/press-kits/covid-19.html\">current global events</a></u>, it&rsquo;s important for people to know that<strong> it has never been easier to respond on their own, either online, by phone, or by mail, without having to meet a census taker.</strong></p>\n<p>To solve this problem and help promote a complete and accurate count of the population, communities, government, creators, and experts have banded together to create engaging content that explains the importance, use, and safety of the census, and how to complete it.&nbsp; These efforts aim&nbsp;<strong>to make the 2020 Census a must-do for communities, particularly those considered &ldquo;</strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/director/2018/11/counting_everyoneon.html\">hard-to-count</a></strong><strong>,&rdquo; such as racial and ethnic minorities, young and mobile populations, families with young children, LGBTQ+, non-English speakers, among others.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>As part of this grassroots outreach effort, it is critical that entertaining and/or humorous content be created in ways that will deeply resonate with a broad audience, with a particular hard-to-count group, or both.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Census Accelerate </u></strong></p>\n<p>This prize challenge is a component of the U.S. Census Bureau&rsquo;s innovation program called <u><a href=\"http://accelerate.census.gov\">Census Accelerate</a></u>. <strong>&nbsp;Census Accelerate</strong> brings together creative professionals, national advocacy organizations, and local leaders to develop community-driven content about the importance of the 2020 Census.</p>\n<p>Its purpose is twofold:</p>\n<ul> <li>to amplify trusted voices in hard-to-count communities so that the messages resonate at a deep level, and</li> <li>to fill content voids that can be exploited with disinformation intended to suppress 2020 census response rates.</li> </ul>\n<p>Census Accelerate is launching this prize competition to reward 2020 Census-related videos with the highest visibility (or viral potential) and the highest impact (i.e., ability to move people to respond to the census). The challenge focuses on <strong>short-format video content </strong>&mdash; a medium that is relatively lacking in quantity and quality on user-generated platforms such as YouTube. The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. &sect; 3719.</p>\n<h2><strong>The challenge:</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Explain why the census matters in a short (30 seconds to 3 minutes) video, designed for a platform such as YouTube, that uses entertainment, emotion, creativity, and/or humor to motivate people to respond. </strong></p>\n<p>Deadline extended to:&nbsp; 05/07/2020 11:59 PM ET</p>\n<h2><strong>FAQ's:</strong></h2>\n<p>See answers to <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/FAQs-Video-Prize Challenge-2020Census.pdf\">frequently asked questions</a>.</p>\n",

Final demonstrations will take place at the 2021 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Global Force Symposium and Exhibition in March 2021 in Huntsville, AL.&nbsp; A grand prize winner will be selected and awarded an additional $250,000 prize.&nbsp; Details on the prize structure are listed below in this announcement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The xTechSearch program will also strives to integrate these small businesses into the Army&rsquo;s S&amp;T ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs, including authorized access to the Army&rsquo;s organic intellectual and technical capital.&nbsp; Every small business idea submitted will receive detailed operational and technical feedback from Army stakeholders.&nbsp; Participating companies will have access to training, mentorship and other support infrastructure as they progress through the contest to determine how best to align their technology solutions with real users and buyers within the Army.&nbsp; Finalists will be entered into the xTech Accelerator to receive intensive mentorship and access to networking events to help grow their companies for Army and commercial users.&nbsp; xTechSearch is an opportunity for businesses to pitch novel technology solutions &ndash; a new application for an existing technology or an entirely new technology concept &ndash; to the Army.</p>\n<p>The authority of this program is 15 United States Code (USC) &sect;3719.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking interactive prototypes for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.</p>\n\n<p>The Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-submission-form-and-frequently-asked-questions\"><strong>NEW! <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-appl.pdf\">Submission Form</a> and <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/redesign-faqs.pdf\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong></h4>\n\n<p><em>About the Department of Education</em></p>\n\n<p>ED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED’s mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.</p>\n\n<p>Although ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation’s schools. However, due to concern that ED would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services).</p>\n\n<p><em>The Current State of ED.gov</em></p>\n\n<p>To achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90 percent of American adults reporting using the internet “<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/276445/number-of-internet-users-in-the-united-states/\">at least occasionally</a>”  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that effort is redesigning ED’s website.</p>\n\n<p>ED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials; non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>\n\n<p>The Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov, www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS) and is hosted externally in a cloud environment.</p>\n\n<p><em>Limitations and Challenges of Current Design</em></p>\n\n<p>Nearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is <a href=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf\">unattractive</a>, and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing <a href=\"https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/20-web-design-facts-small-business-owners/\">credibility</a>. Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages with, the content on ED.gov.</p>\n\n<p>The last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content layouts using responsive design.</p>\n\n<p>While the update included several important changes, the design fell short in key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that meets their needs. The current site:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Remains difficult to navigate;</li>\n  <li>Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user experience;</li>\n  <li>Relies too heavily on text;</li>\n  <li>Is antiquated; and</li>\n  <li>Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov</em></p>\n\n<p>The goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design, navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The challenge is for design prototypes only.</strong> The design prototypes received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still, applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more details below).</p>\n\n<p>ED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should focus on that foundation.

Invited participant names are listed below in alphabetical order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>ADA Technologies, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Americase, LLC</li>\n  <li>Cornerstone Research Group, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Energy Storage Safety Products International, LLC</li>\n  <li>Fire Containment Concepts</li>\n  <li>KULR Technology Corp.</li>\n  <li>Mistral, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Proycon Alpha Squared, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Purdue University</li>\n  <li>Scimitar Technologies</li>\n  <li>StatDiagnostics</li>\n  <li>Texas Research Institute - Austin</li>\n  <li>ViPER (Purdue University)</li>\n  <li>Zarges Inc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lithium batteries’ benefits of increased capabilities at a reduced weight outweigh their inherent risks in many industrial, commercial and some military applications. However, these benefits do not outweigh the inherent risk of transporting the batteries. For example, most commercial passenger airlines do not allow lithium batteries to be packed inside checked luggage due to the inherent fire hazard in a cargo hold, which represents an unacceptable risk. Likewise, military (and other users) transportation of lithium batteries represents risks that are also sometimes unacceptable. A solution that develops a containment system to carry batteries that suitably mitigates the inherent hazards is desired to allow more applications, commercial and military, to benefit from the use of rechargeable (called “secondary”) and non-rechargeable (called “primary”) lithium batteries.</p>\n\n<p>The objective for this Lithium Battery Man Portable Containment Challenge is to demonstrate a method to transport military-qualified lithium primary and secondary batteries that mitigates hazards generated during a thermal runaway event. Since some lithium batteries are more reactive than other types, a proposed solution does not have to accommodate all types of current military lithium batteries, but a solution that does accommodate more lithium battery types is more valuable for the purposes of this challenge. Man portable can be defined as a single person carry up to 50 Lbs, which will include up to 12.5 Lbs of batteries. The challenge assumes no battery charging or discharging will occur during transportation of lithium batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Additional threshold parameters include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Contain or extinguish all fire and large (greater than 5 micrometers diameter) particulates generated during a thermal runaway event</li>\n  <li>Limit and neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released gases from the container</li>\n  <li>Be stackable with secure attachment points for carrying straps, handles, tie-down</li>\n  <li>Securely immobilize the contained batteries</li>\n  <li>Provide a degree of shock and vibration isolation for the batteries contained</li>\n  <li>Provide a degree of water and moisture protection for the batteries contained</li>\n  <li>Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in circumference and 11.5” in radius</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additional stretch objectives parameters include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Be capable of containing all vent gases</li>\n  <li>Be capable of reducing the hazards of released toxic vent gases</li>\n  <li>Ability to convey externally that a hazardous event has occurred inside the container</li>\n  <li>Ability to suppress or extinguish the thermal runaway event internal to the container</li>\n  <li>Reduction in physical dimension and/or weight to improve portability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The challenge will be completed via a four Phased approach. Phase I objective is to provide a concept “white paper” from which a Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept may be invited. Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate a limited Proof-of-Concept (POC). Phase III objective is to fabricate and demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. Phase IV will include any potential follow-on award(s). The Government may, at its discretion, award follow-on(s) for the continuous development of the technology development. The Government does not currently have funding for follow-on award(s).</p>\n\n<p>Detailed solution is defined as a technical illustration or Computer aided Design (CAD) model of the proposed solution with consideration to threshold parameters. POC is defined as a small project created to test whether a certain idea or theory about the product can be implemented. Technology Development Prototype is defined as a product that is capable to be tested to successfully demonstrate the ability to meet the challenge objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Phase I objective is to “virtually” (e.g. via a phone or video conference) present your concept. Phase I will be conducted in two phases: Initial submission of White Paper Concept followed by an invitation to provide a Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept. The White Paper Concept shall describe in detail the Challenge objectives your solution will address, how your proposed solution would achieve those objectives, how if selected for Phase II you intend to design your solution, what POC will be developed and evaluated and describe your plans for how you would intend for your solution to be manufactured and sold.</p>\n\n<p>The Government will select up to fifteen (15) White Paper Concepts for invitation for a Virtual Presentation of their proposed concept to a panel of judges. The Virtual Presentation shall provide a summary of the white paper contents and include detail on how you intend to accomplish phase II objectives, provide a notional schedule, and a list of any concerns, clarifications or other questions you have regarding resources or information you need technical assistance with to accomplish the challenge. Up to five (5) winners will be selected to participate in Phase II.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate any Proof-of-Concept (POC) needed to provide confidence in the design. Results from the detailed design and POC testing will be provided to the Government team via another Virtual Presentation. Presentation should also include data supporting effectiveness of design along with identification of what design attributes will be considered vendor versus government purpose rights. Up to three (3) winners will be selected to participate in Phase III.</p>\n\n<p>Phase III objective is to demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. The Technology Development Prototype will be required to demonstrate the capability of withstanding the thermal runaway event of four lithium-ion military BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar ~300 Wh Li-ion batteries. A single center-located battery should be triggered artificially by means of thermal abuse (e.g. via heat tape or some other suitable method). The technology development prototype should demonstrate the capability at ambient temperature to contain the thermal event without releasing flame, sparks or large particles while maintaining a surface temperature that would not trigger the combustion of adjacent materials. The container should also limit and preferably neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released gases. Note that this type of testing is inherently hazardous, and Government personnel will consult with you on the safe execution of this POC in advance. All three winners may be selected to participate in Phase IV.</p>\n\n<p>Phase IV the Government may choose to award follow-on FAR-based procurement contract, an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or 2371b), a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U.S.C 2373), or a combination of awards under those authorities to any chosen participant in this prize challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Initial submission of the White Paper Concept shall not exceed five pages and required to be in the following format.</p>\n\n<p>a.

This effort, as with all Government projects, has its own set of deadlines and metrics that we must meet independent of the COVID-19 impacts. Our position is that the additional two-week extension that was given to extend the submission deadline to 07 May 2020 is sufficient for interested organizations to develop the minimalistic white paper submission required for Phase I. We do not intend at this time to provide any additional extensions to this initial phase of this challenge.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: While carefully reading the threshold parameters, we came across “Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in circumference and 11.5” in radius”. It looks like that you are assuming the cylindrical object to hold four batteries and not rectangular. However, in order to have 36” circumference, is the 11.5” is radius or diameter. If its diameter, the calculations for circumference C (36”) = 2PI r = 2x3.14x5.75 would make sense. Please clarify.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: The requirement is that one orientation of the containment system must have a maximum diameter of 23”. This containment system does not have to have a side that is round.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Please clarify the dimension requirements and in particular this: “Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in circumference and 11.5” in radius”. For a rectangular enclosure of dimensions 14.5” x 13.5” x 5.5”, how would you calculate the sides circumference and radius for such enclosure? Would it meet your requirements?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: The requirement is that one orientation of the containment system must have a maximum diameter of 23”. This containment system does not have to have a side that is round.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Are the cells used in the BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG military battery cylindrical cells (i.e. 18650 or similar dimension) ; or are they polymer flat cells?</p>\n\n<p>a. If they are cylindrical cells, how many cells comprise the battery? What is the composition of the cells and at what percentages? (i.e. Li-Cobalt, Li-Nickel, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>b. If they are polymer flat cells, how many cells comprise the battery? What is the composition of the cells and at what percentages?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Answer: The BB-2590 batteries use the cylindrical format 18650 Li-ion cells configured as two series sets, each with 3 parallel strings of 4 cells in series, for 24 cells total in each BB-2590.</em></p>\n\n    <p><em>a. For the answers, you may refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provided by the BB-2590 manufacturer for details on chemistry and composition of the cells used in the battery. As for cell count, you can obtain the number of cells based on the cell chemistry characteristics, case dimensions, battery overall capacity and voltage.</em></p>\n\n    <p><em>b. Not applicable.</em></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Can a company that is currently producing similar products and selling them modify a product to specifications set forth, or does the USN desire a prototype developed strictly for their use?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: As stated in the challenge, either a BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar approximately 300 Wh Li-ion battery may be used. If you produce a battery that can be proposed for the challenge as “similar” to the BB-2590 (meaning sufficiently close in Wh, voltage range, packaging and dimensions), that would be acceptable. You may submit details of your proposed substitute and we can give you a more definitive answer as to the suitability for the purposes of the challenge.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: What type of battery case is used for these batteries? E.g., metal and type of metal, plastic and type of plastic as well as thickness of plastic, other case materials?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: For details on the construction of the BB-2590 type batteries referenced in the challenge, please refer to the “military performance specification” document that specifies attributes of this type of battery. You may download this document, MIL-PRF-32052/1, from the web. The case is plastic, with an approximate thickness of 1/16th inch. Other case materials are listed generically in the manufacturers Safety Data Sheet document.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Are there vents or other pressure relief mechanisms on the battery cases?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: For details on the construction of the BB-2590 type batteries (including the case vent) referenced in the challenge, please refer to the “military performance specification” document that specifies attributes of this type of battery. You may download this document, MIL-PRF-32052/1, from the web.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: What is the Wh rating of the individual cells in these batteries at 100% State of Charge (SOC)?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: For the Wh rating of the individual cells, you may refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provided by the BB-2590 manufacturer for details on chemistry and composition of the cells used in the battery you chose. It is possible to estimate the cell-level Wh rating for the specific cells being used in the BB-2590 you are considering using. The Wh estimate can be calculated from the number of cells in the battery (24 total for BB-2590, configured as two series sets, each with 3 parallel strings of 4 cells in series), the cell chemistry characteristics, and, battery overall capacity and voltage.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Will NSWC assist us in sourcing the military versions of these batteries from the manufacturer(s) and authorized distributors?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: Given the time and resources it would take to acquire and distribute these batteries and the process involved with re-selling or otherwise supplying “government furnished materials,” NSWC Crane will not be able to provide batteries to participants. The BB-2590 type battery referred to in the challenge can be readily purchased from multiple sources.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Alternatively, would NSWC be willing to purchase the military versions of these batteries in bulk for participants in the challenge and sell them to participants at cost?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: Given the time and resources it would take to acquire and distribute these batteries and the process involved with re-selling or otherwise supplying “government furnished materials,” NSWC Crane will not be able to provide batteries to participants. The BB-2590 type battery referred to in the challenge can be readily purchased from multiple sources.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: We currently produce a containment system that has been tested to similar standards. Can we modify that product for the challenge or does the USN want a completely new product?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: Yes, you can modify your current containment product to meet the goals of the challenge. Note that the judging criteria rewards innovation in proposed solutions over existing products. Modifications to existing products would still be regarded positively if the innovation substantially enhanced the existing product’s performance.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: For the Proof of Concept testing at what state of charge (SOC) is required of the battery during testing?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: All batteries are required to be at 100% SOC.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Does the “references” section (i.e., the bibliography of references used to prepare the white paper) at the end of the white paper count toward the five-page limit? The NSWC-CR document provided in Challenge.gov does not talk about this although the document does state that the cover sheets at the beginning of the white paper concept will not be counted toward the five-page limit.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: The references page is not included the page count limitation.</em></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>The Public Safety Communications Research Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting the Automated Streams Analysis for Public Safety (ASAPS) Prize Challenge, authorized under Section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No 111-358), as codified in 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</p>\n\n<p>This challenge anticipates awarding prizes to challenge contestants who submit innovative approaches that address information extraction across ASAPS multimodal data streams and perform fusion in real time across extracted data to generate actionable data reports about simulated and staged emergency events. One of the most important objectives of this program is to demonstrate how data can be used to enable decision support tools and capabilities for public safety. This challenge is a nationwide innovation contest taking place throughout 2020, 2021, and 2022. The challenge is anticipated to be administered in four discrete contests. In the context of multiple contests, these are the official rules for Contest 1 only.</p>\n\n<p>Contest 1 will focus on developing innovative “plans of attack” focused on data extraction and fusion, refining and focusing the details relevant to the ASAPS Challenge’s problem statement, partnering between contestants to form highly qualified teams, and encouraging collaborative and creative thought around potential approaches to developing solutions. NIST anticipates awarding up to $150,000 in cash to winning contestants in Contest 1. In addition, contestants will be familiarized with the development data set and version 1.0 of the test harness and encouraged to provide feedback for potential updates in advance of the second contest.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Pre-registration begins: February 10, 2020</li>\n  <li>Open to submissions: April 13, 2020</li>\n  <li>Submission deadline: August 7, 2020 @ 5pm ET</li>\n  <li>Reviewing &amp; Judging: August 10 to September 14, 2020</li>\n  <li>Winners Announced: September 17, 2020</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The area of real-time automated analytics is understudied – especially with regards to the analytic fusion of multiple sources of unstructured information in real-time. The future of public safety demands automated solutions to analyze live data, provide improved situational awareness, and alert and inform decision making.</p>\n\n<p>Extracting information from video, audio and textual communications, social media, and sensors presents a significant analytic challenge. It is virtually impossible for humans to co-analyze these data streams in real-time, and, currently, there are few automated tools to analyze these types of unstructured data in real-time and virtually no automated tools to create dynamic analytic models of public safety emergencies as emergency situations evolve.</p>\n\n<p>With the maturation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specialized architectures and processors for AI applications, cloud computing, high-speed communications networks and streaming data resources and protocols, it is now possible to create automated tools to assist public safety organizations in analyzing the increasingly large amounts of information at their fingertips to help them make the most informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of the data available. Such tools will help distill, structure, and present the quickly evolving information from a multitude of data streams to public safety organizations in a way that supports time-critical decision making and serves as an essential force multiplier.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the multitude of sensors and devices being used in public safety along with communications data collected in operations and contributed by the public, and the multi-modal nature of all of these data streams, transforming data, especially unstructured data, into information in real-time is one of the key technology gaps that must be bridged to achieve advances in this area. The available technology is insufficient to bridge this technological gap because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Most automated data analysis tools have been developed for use with archival data and focus on post-event forensic analysis.</li>\n  <li>Few analytic technologies focus on a moving representation of live streaming data that is updated over time, and that can be used to show temporal changes in the analysis.</li>\n  <li>Tools that make data available to first responders in real-time are heavily weighted towards a visual representation of responder location and structured reporting of known emergency communications.</li>\n  <li>Few public safety emergency analysis tools exist that provide an effective real-time automated analysis and fusion of information from unstructured public safety communications streams and sensor- and citizen-generated data streams.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that while public safety organizations must often grapple with answering the who, what, when, and where of emergencies, the research supported by this Challenge focuses only on the what, when, and where aspects of streaming data analysis and specifically excludes identity-related technologies such as facial and voice biometrics which are considered out of scope for this research program - with the exception of technology to maintain scene-relative identification of people/vehicle/object/place entities involved in emergencies in order to associate activities with the entities they are involved with. This focus of the Challenge is because the area of identifying the situational and time-critical evolving characteristics of an emergency across information streams is under-researched. This Challenge seeks to focus research on analyzing a plethora of fast-moving data streams for life/infrastructure-critical situational information to support both effective and efficient response.</p>\n\n<p>Public safety organizations are inundated with live streaming data from a variety of sources. This live streaming data generally falls into two categories - some of this data is structured, while much of it is unstructured. Structured data that resides in a fixed field within a record or file (the kind typically found in spreadsheets or relational databases) is formatted in a way so that it can be readily queried. By contrast, unstructured data (e.g., video and audio) generally does not have a pre-<em>defined data</em> model or is not organized in a pre-<em>defined</em> manner and, therefore, is not readily searchable. The lack of a defined data model prevents the data from being automatically interpreted and used by automated decision support applications without significant human intervention.</p>\n\n<p>In this first contest, NIST PSCR is inviting a novel multidisciplinary community to share its vision for how to analyze numerous live data streams, understand the data, and transform it into information to support public safety decisions. We are looking for ideas that address the following analytic tasks as well as an overall extraction to analysis systems platform approach to the contest elements. The core analytic tasks for this contest can be broadly described as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Information extraction across data streams and data sources:</strong> Structured information is continuously extracted from each of the data streams that are necessary to support downstream analysis and detection of emergency events.</li>\n  <li><strong>Information fusion across extracted data and generation of live/dynamic information representation:</strong> Joint inferencing is performed across all of the information in the extracted streams to create an event-level analysis of an emergency and store that information in a dynamically evolving structured data representation that can be utilized at any time during the life of an emergency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Automated emergency event analysis:</strong>Highly actionable analytic reports about emergency events are generated from the extracted/fused structured information (as described in the above topics) into a form that can be readily rendered into actionable user-readable reports in real-time and in both ongoing and summary forms.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Success in this ideation contest is dependent upon a clear vision of the components, platform, and novel approaches that fulfill the functions of real-time information extraction, live dynamic information fusion and representation, and evolving emergency event analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Figure 1.

Zerges, Director, Office of the Chief Technology Officer, GSA</em></p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI), or machine learning (ML) solution that will review end-user license agreements (EULA) for terms and conditions that are unacceptable to the government. On average it takes all parties involved approximately 7-14 days to review an EULA and ensure that all unacceptable terms and conditions are identified.</p>\n\n<p>A EULA details the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of software or services. It can also be known as a software license agreement or acceptable use policy. As part of the acquisition process of software or services, GSA reviews the associated EULAs. This review must be completed prior to awarding new contracts or modifying existing contracts. A GSA contracting officer (CO) reviews applicable EULAs for terms and conditions that are not in accordance with Federal law and regulations. The CO may also coordinate a legal review with the Office of General Counsel if they feel it is warranted. Should EULAs contain language that would conflict with Federal law and regulations, the CO must negotiate changes to the EULA to remove the problematic language.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for a solution that will use AI and/or ML to improve this manual process. The solution will include a user interface that GSA will use to process the documents and identify unacceptable clauses/terms in the EULAs. <strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uOBFIqoOJ8k\">Watch our AI / ML challenge video</a> to learn more about the desired solution.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This solution will decrease the time spent manually reviewing EULAs and free resources to focus on other aspects of the acquisition process.  It will also improve the accuracy and consistency of the review process.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"data-provided\">Data Provided:</h4>\n\n<p>All Solvers (individuals, teams, or legal entities) shall have access to the following data for use in creating their solutions.

For this challenge, PRO data are defined as “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or other medical expert.” In other words, PRO data come from patient self-assessments and look beyond the clinical data to assess how a patient feels about his or her health.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-problem\"><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>\n\n<p>While PRO data have proven useful to healthcare providers, they are not widely used in clinical settings. Recently, some digital tools have been developed to streamline the collection of PRO data. However, those digital tools are not widely adopted due to challenges related to clinician workflow and patient ease with the tools. Also, researchers who want to analyze PRO data across different practices or health systems often encounter the issue that data are not collected in a standardized manner. Creating a digital tool to efficiently collect, aggregate, and share PRO data is critical to advancing the quality of care.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-1-winners\"><strong>Phase 1 Winners</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Step Up App Challenge is seeking innovative technologists to develop user-friendly apps that collect standardized PRO data for clinical and research purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1 winners announced:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>AgilisIT:</strong> AgilisITTM’s solution focuses on patient engagement, ease of use for physicians, and EHR integration in order to encourage the digital collection of PRO data. The patient centered app offers both mobile and web applications, enabling patients to receive reminders and track their own progress while providers can receive patient health notifications and easily review data to prepare treatment plans based on patient priorities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asymmetrik:</strong> Asymmetrik’s Phoenix Integration PlatformTMallows healthcare providers to use FHIR®to leverage existing investments in data infrastructure, simplify data analytics to make informed decisions across health systems, and deploy secure, data-driven applications for researchers, doctors, and patients.

            "description": "<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\n<p>The global wildlife trade is actively spreading a deadly disease that could cause hundreds, if not thousands, of the world&rsquo;s 7,000 known species of amphibians to go extinct unless we take immediate action to combat its spread. This disease is caused by two species of pathogenic chytrid fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans(Bsal), which were recently introduced to amphibian populations. These fungi thrive in wet cool environments, and amphibians in at least 60 countries have already been exposed.</p>\n<p>Every year, millions of amphibians are traded globally for use as pets, food, and research, without any required disease screening prior to transport. In each shipment, the number of amphibians can range from one to many thousands and must be quickly released to the importer. Bd and Bsal are invisible to the naked eye, and infections rarely cause visible symptoms prior to death. Therefore, genetic sampling and laboratory analysis are the most common detection method. Rapid, cost-effective chytrid detection methods are urgently needed to stop infected animals and contaminated shipping materials from entering the USA to reduce the threat of disease to native biodiversity.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Amphibian chytrid fungi are lethal to frogs and salamanders, and we must be able to detect its presence before we can eradicate it from infected animals. This challenge seeks innovative solutions to rapidly confirm and quantify the presence of chytrid fungi (Bd and Bsal) through non-invasive techniques in material imported into the United States. This includes detection on live animals, in water samples, and on surfaces of shipping containers (cardboard boxes, plastic bags, etc.). Detection is the first step towards a longer-term goal of developing treatments to safely eradicate Bd and Bsal from large commercial shipments of live amphibians that are imported for human consumption.</p>\n<p>There are three focus areas of this challenge:</p>\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp; LIVE ANIMALS ROADBLOCK:&nbsp; LIVE ANIMALS CANNOT BE HARMED OR HELD FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.</strong></p>\n<p>Amphibians are purchased as exotic pets, for human consumption (as frogs legs), and biomedical research subjects, and therefore, cannot be damaged in the detection process. These animals must be released to importers as quickly as possible following their arrival in order to protect their health (in a matter of a couple hours, or less, following importation). Currently, the time required to submit DNA samples to a laboratory and obtain results can be days, if not weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; WATER SAMPLES ROADBLOCK:&nbsp; LARGE WATER SAMPLES ARE CURRENTLY NEEDED TO DETECT LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF BD/BSAL</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to the current Bd/Bsal detection methods on a live animal, a water filter sample must be collected and submitted to a laboratory for molecular analysis where the presence of pathogen DNA can be confirmed via<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\">&nbsp;PCR</a>. Each sample can cost approximately $20-$40 to have processed, and low pathogen concentrations may dip below current genetic detection limits to accurately and confidently identify the presence of Bd/Bsal in water. We invite solutions to test and detect Bd/Bsal in water using low-cost techniques with a fast turn-around time between sample and result.</p>\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp; SUBSTRATES AND SURFACES OF SHIPPING MATERIALS ROADBLOCK:&nbsp; SUBSTRATES LIKE SHIPPING MATERIALS, SOIL, AND BAGS CAN HOST BD/BSAL ZOOSPHORES UNDETECTABLE BY SIGHT</strong></p>\n<p>We invite solutions to test and detect Bd/Bsal on shipping materials (cardboard boxes, plastic bags, etc.) using low-cost techniques with a fast turn-around time between sample and result.</p>\n<p><strong>Criteria</strong></p>\n<p>This challenge seeks innovative approaches that provide fast results after sample collection, the ability to test many samples per shipment, and a low price per sample.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>SPEED:</strong>&nbsp;The time from sample collection to Bd/Bsal detection confirmation should be under 15 minutes.</li> <li><strong>COST:</strong>&nbsp;Cost per sample should aim to be less US$1. The overall cost for detecting the presence of Bd/Bsal in a shipment must be less than US$50.</li> <li><strong>POWER:</strong>&nbsp;Detection must be performed onsite without access to electricity.</li> <li><strong>ACCURACY:</strong>&nbsp;The test must exceed the Bd qPCR sensitivity and specificity of 72.9% and 94.2%, respectively, as per Skerratt et al. (2011) and be able to detect the presence of 1 or more Bd/Bsal zoospore equivalents.</li> <li><strong>NON-INVASIVE TO ANY ANIMAL:</strong>&nbsp;A tissue sample must not be required from any animal, whether live or dead, but skin swabs and water samples are allowed (one current invasive method of chytrid detection is by microscopic examination to observe the presence of infection in a tissue sample).</li> <li><strong>QUANTIFICATION:</strong>&nbsp;The test must be able to quantify the burden of infection present (pathogen load).</li> <li><strong>IDENTIFICATION:&nbsp;</strong>Results must provide the information needed to identify the lineage of pathogen present.</li> </ul>\n<p>The ability to quantify the pathogen load is also desired, though not a required capability of a successful solution.</p>\n",

EPA will award up to $50,000 in prize money to the best performing sensor prototypes! Download the Testing Application at <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal</a>, due July 26, 2019!</strong></p> <p>Conventional on-site wastewater treatment systems, or OWTS, (also referred to as septic systems) are not designed to remove nitrogen to the extent required for avoiding harmful algal blooms and for protecting and restoring many productive and valuable marine and coastal waters. Successfully removing nitrogen to address these concerns may require use of more advanced technology in OWTS. Regulatory officials recognize the benefit and value of solutions that remove high nitrogen levels but need more confidence in the long-term performance of I/A OWTS technologies before approving their use. Effective long-term management of I/A nitrogen removal OWTS requires data that provides a real- time indication of proper functioning over the lifetime of the treatment system. <strong>A sensor which can measure the nitrogen concentration in I/A OWTS effluent coupled with real time reporting would give regulators, managers, communities and homeowners improved ability to assure systems are working properly, optimize their performance, and maintain these technologies over their lifetime, as well as provide the information needed to assess the effectiveness of restoration actions on receiving waters.</strong> Cost effective verification of system performance through use of a nitrogen sensor will protect public health and the environment, provide data to confirm and revise estimates of watershed-wide nutrient loadings, allow for more accurate models of nitrogen impact on receiving waters, and offer evidence of reasonable return on investment for homeowners and communities.</p> <p>The ideal sensor would provide accurate measurement of total nitrogen in I/A OWTS effluent, include telemetry, be self-calibrating or require infrequent calibration, last 10 years, require no more than 1 maintenance visit per year and cost the homeowner less than $1,000. Such an ideal technology may not be possible. At a minimum, a sensor would provide accurate measurement of nitrate (NO-3) and ammonium (NH+4), be easily accessed and maintained (no more than four maintenance visits per year), require infrequent calibration, last 5 years and cost less than $1,500. Because Total Nitrogen is composed of organic and inorganic fractions, measuring NO-3 and NH+4 may significantly underestimate Total Nitrogen. To address this, the near-ideal sensor would measure NO-3 and NH+4, as well as Total Organic Carbon (TOC). The TOC value would be used to estimate Organic Nitrogen using an empirically-derived value of the nitrogen content of the TOC.</p> <p>Phase I of the Challenge requested submissions of sensor designs having the capabilities discussed above, and awards were given at the June 29, 2017 Sensor Showcase Day.</p> <p>Phase II, the Prototype Testing Program, is being managed by EPA. EPA selected Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) to support the development of a Test/Quality Assurance Plan and Verification Protocol (T/QAP) and oversee the testing of the sensor prototypes. Battelle is collaborating with <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal</a> to ensure compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a> Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Standard - 14034. Phase II testing is being conducted at the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center (<a href=\"https://www.barnstablecountyhealth.org/programs-and-services/massachusetts-alternative-septic-system-test-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MASSTC</a>), a National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) certified test facility in Barnstable, Massachusetts.  Funding for the testing program is from the US EPA Office of Research and Development and the Office of Water/Wastewater Management.</p> <p>Battelle has convened a Technical Panel to provide the technical input and expertise necessary to develop an effective verification protocol and T/QAP based on the ISO ETV Standard 14034.  The Technical Panel includes experts from EPA, US Geological Survey (USGS), the Alliance for Coastal Technologies, the University of Maryland, the New England Onsite Wastewater Training Program at the University of Rhode Island (URI), the MASSTC, onsite regulators from MA and Suffolk County NY, the National Onsite Wastewater Recycling Association (NOWRA – onsite wastewater manufacturers are members of this association), the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University, and other university engineering programs.</p> <h3>Phase II Prototype Testing 2019-2020</h3> <p>The first step of the preliminary screening process is a one-week test. It is scheduled to run from <strong>August 21 through August 27, 2019,</strong> with sensor set up dates of August 19 and 20. <strong>For this final round of open prototype testing, EPA will award up to $50,000 in prize money to the best performing sensor(s).</strong> This prototype testing is the last opportunity that is open to all sensor developers (not dependent on previous participation) that believe their sensor prototype can meet or exceed the performance goals of the Challenge detailed in the Test and Quality Assurance Plan (T/QAP). <strong>Sensor developers that are interested in participating in the one-week test must submit an application which can be found on <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal</a> by July 26, 2019.</strong></p> <p>In addition to the cash prize, sensors which meet the Challenge performance goals will be invited to participate in the one-month screening test, which is tentatively planned for December 2019. Sensors which pass the one-month test will be invited to the six-month ISO ETV 14034 field verification test, which is tentatively scheduled for May through November 2020.

Then join this exciting data privacy competition with <strong>up to $150,000 in prizes</strong>, where participants will create new or improved differentially private synthetic data generation tools.&nbsp; When a data set has important public value but contains sensitive personal information and can&rsquo;t be directly shared with the public, privacy-preserving synthetic data tools solve the problem by producing new, artificial data that can serve as a practical replacement for the original sensitive data, with respect to common analytics tasks such as clustering, classification and regression.&nbsp; By mathematically proving that a synthetic data generator satisfies the rigorous Differential Privacy guarantee, we can be confident that the synthetic data it produces won&rsquo;t contain any information that can be traced back to specific individuals in the original data.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge&rdquo; will entail a sequence of three marathon matches run on the Topcoder platform, asking contestants to design and implement their own synthetic data generation algorithms, mathematically prove their algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and then enter it to compete against others&rsquo; algorithms on empirical accuracy over real data, with the prospect of advancing research in the field of Differential Privacy.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not a differential privacy expert, and you&rsquo;d like to learn, join the Topcoder community for tutorials to help you catch up and compete!&nbsp; <strong>Join, learn, and compete for $150,000 in prizes!</strong></p>\n<h4>How Important Is This?</h4>\n<p>This challenge is focused on proactively protecting individual privacy while allowing for public safety data to be used by researchers for positive purposes and outcomes.&nbsp; NIST&rsquo;s PSCR (public safety communications research) has strong commitments to both public safety research and the preservation of security and privacy, including the use of de-identification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no absolute protection that data will not be misused.&nbsp; Even a dataset that protects individual identities may, if it gets into the wrong hands, be used for ill purposes.&nbsp; Weaknesses in the security of the original data can threaten the privacy of individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that privacy in data release is an important area for the Federal Government (which has an Open Data Policy), state governments, the public safety sector and many commercial non-governmental organizations.&nbsp; Developments coming out of this competition would hopefully drive major advances in the practical applications of differential privacy for these organizations.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this series of competitions is to provide a platform for researchers to develop more advanced differentially private methods that can substantially improve the privacy protection and utility of the resulting datasets.</p>\n<h4>Get Involved - How to Participate</h4>\n<p><em>&gt;Note:&nbsp; All submissions for this challenge are being collected through the <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder website</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge is phase 2 of <a href=\"https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge/overview\">The Unlinkable Data Challenge:&nbsp; Advancing Methods in Differential Privacy</a>, where competitors wrote concept papers to identify new approaches to de-identification and inform the final coding design of this challenge.&nbsp; Participants of this challenge will create an algorithm and participate in a sequence of Marathon Matches. Throughout each marathon match, participants will design and implement their own differentially private synthetic data generation algorithm, mathematically prove that their algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and enter it to compete against others&rsquo; algorithms on empirical accuracy over real data, with the prospect of advancing the understanding in the field of Differential Privacy.</p>\n<p>This is a multi-phased contest with three marathon matches. Competitors may enter the contest at any point to participate between November 2018 and April 2019. Topcoder will bring the registrations from previous matches to the next matches.</p>\n<p>The marathon mechanism will provide participants with immediate feedback about the quality of their submission using an online leaderboard, which allows teams to repeatedly improve and validate the capabilities of their algorithms through several phases of increasing difficulty. In each marathon, participants are able to make changes to their algorithm, team with other Topcoder members and watch their opponents move up and down the leaderboard. The final stage in each marathon match will be a sequestered stage where participants submit their final code to be rigorously tested and evaluated.&nbsp; Where a competitor's algorithm falls with respect to the utility-privacy frontier curve will determine who wins at each marathon match.</p>\n<h4>Prize Schedule</h4>\n<p>The Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge consists of a sequence of three Marathon Matches with increasing difficulty. Each marathon match is approximately two months in length.&nbsp; For all prize eligibility, the submissions must be certified (see Match contest rule \\#8) in advance and the participants will have 24 hours to supply their code base to re-confirm their certifications.</p>\n<h4>Summary of Important Dates</h4>\n<p>Pre-registration Begins:&nbsp; October 5, 2018</p>\n<p>Challenge Launch:&nbsp; October 31, 2018 @ 9 a.m. ET</p>\n<p>Match \\#1:&nbsp; competitors submit October 31 - November 29, 2018</p>\n<p>Match \\#2:&nbsp; competitors submit January 11 - February 9, 2019</p>\n<p>Match \\#3:&nbsp; competitors submit March 10 - April 23, 2019</p>\n<p>Final Scoring Deadline:&nbsp; April 2019 (Refer to Challenge Timeline on <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder website</a>&nbsp;under each Match page)</p>\n<p>Final Winners Announced:&nbsp; May 20, 2019 (Interim Match Winnners posted under the \"Winners\" tab)</p>\n<h4>How Do I Win?</h4>\n<p>To be eligible for an award, your submission must, at minimum:</p>\n<ul> <li>Meet the eligibility requirements in the NIST PSCR Official Challenge Rules posted on Challenge.gov under the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; tab.</li> <li>Satisfy compliance review based on completion of the Certification Process (Match contest rule \\#8) at each match, and if you are a top scorer, submit a report for Final Review (Match contest rule \\#9).</li> <li>Score higher than your competitors!</li> </ul>\n<h4>Prizes</h4>\n<p>A total prize purse of up to $150,000 is available for this Challenge. Here is a breakdown:</p>\n<h4><strong>Final Prizes</strong></h4>\n<p>For the final prize of each match the top participants&nbsp;(1st through 5th place) will be invited via email to the final round of testing, the sequestered phase, by providing their solution in the form of a Dockerfile within 7 days of the end of the submission phase. This Dockerfile will contain their solution (source code) which will be run against the sequestered set of data and ground truth.&nbsp; A set of analytics will be run against the generated privatized data, and the same analytics will be run against the raw dataset.&nbsp; &nbsp;The results of the analytics (clustering, categorization, and linear regression) of the two sets of data will be compared using appropriate similarity scores, and a total accuracy score will be computed that represents the final score for that participant.&nbsp; The top leaders will be required to provide written documents defining their solution and providing a clear, correct proof that their solution satisfies differential privacy (see Match contest rule \\#9, Final Review).&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Progressive Prizes</strong></h4>\n<p>There are multiple ways for Challenge leaders to win progressive prizes halfway through each match and prior to the final round. Progressive prizes are announced when the Challenge is publicly launched and awarded based on the participants placement on the provisional leaderboard at an exact time (approximately half way through the challenge), and their provisional testing score (not the sequestered results).&nbsp; These prizes are awarded to the Top 4 pre-certified participants from the provisional leaderboard once their code has been inspected.&nbsp; There are 4 progressive prizes available for each marathon match at $1000 each.</p>\n<h4><strong>Additional Prizes</strong></h4>\n<p>An additional prize of $4000 may be awarded to each of the top 5 award winning teams at the end of the final marathon match who agree to provide and do provide their full code solution in an open source repository for use by all interested parties.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prize Summary</strong></h4>\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; height:246px;\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr style=\"height:18px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"><strong>Match 1</strong></td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"><strong>Match 2</strong></td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"><strong>Match 3</strong></td> </tr> <tr style=\"height:174px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:174px;\"> <p>1st Plac&nbsp;$10,000</p> <p>2nd Plac&nbsp;$7,000</p> <p>3rd Plac&nbsp;$5,000</p> <p>4th Plac&nbsp;$2,000</p> <p>5th Plac&nbsp;$1,000</p> </td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:174px;\"> <p>1st Plac&nbsp;$15,000</p> <p>2nd Plac&nbsp;$10,000</p> <p>3rd Plac&nbsp;$5,000</p> <p>4th Plac&nbsp;$3,000</p> <p>5th Plac&nbsp;$2,000</p> </td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:174px;\"> <p>1st Plac&nbsp;$25,000</p> <p>2nd Plac&nbsp;$15,000</p> <p>3rd Plac&nbsp;$10,000</p> <p>4th Plac&nbsp;$5,000</p> <p>5th Plac&nbsp;$3,000</p> </td> </tr> <tr style=\"height:18px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"> <p>Progressive Priz&nbsp;4 x $1,000</p> </td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Progressive Priz&nbsp;4 x $1,000</td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Progressive Priz&nbsp;4 x $1,000</td> </tr> <tr style=\"height:18px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Total:&nbsp;$29,000</td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Total:&nbsp;$39,000</td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Total:&nbsp;$62,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<p><em>*&nbsp;An additional prize of $4000 may be awarded to each of the top 5 award winning teams at the end of the final marathon match who agree to provide and do provide their full code solution in an open source repository for use by all interested parties.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Total Prize Purse for Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challeng&nbsp;$150,000.</strong></em></p>\n<h4>Questions?</h4>\n<p>For questions about the Official Rules or Challenge, contact <a href=\"mailto:PSprizes@nist.gov\">PSprizes@nist.gov</a> with &ldquo;Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge&rdquo; in the subject.</p>\n",

This Challenge will tentatively run from October 31 2018 to May 6 2019 and be divided into a sequence of three matches.&nbsp; Each match will introduce new constraints to the scoring function, described later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Upon registration for the challenge, the participants will receive one (1) or more datasets bifurcated into training and testing data in addition to instructions or pseudo code to generate the ground truth for the training set for all matches to date.</p>\n<p>3. For match 1 the ground truth will be generated using only Clustering Analysis.</p>\n<p>4. For match 2 the ground truth will be generated using Clustering and Classification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. For match 3 the ground truth will be generated using Clustering, Classification and Regression Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. Inside the JSON submission payload, participants will receive a value of delta from NIST/Topcoder and will submit their synthetic datasets at three different values of epsilon:&nbsp; 0.1, 1, 10.&nbsp; A test harness (shell script and or Jar file) will be provided to sequentially run the participant solutions with different epsilon values that will concatenate and format the output for submission to Topcoder.&nbsp; Participants with algorithms that produce high quality privatized synthetic data on smaller values of epsilon, will receive higher scores.</p>\n<p>7. Upon proper submission, participants will be redirected to the leaderboard where they will see their handle and the new score.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8. Certification Process:&nbsp; All participants will be required to submit a complete written explanation of their algorithm, and a clear, correct mathematical proof that their solution satisfies differential privacy, to a dedicated mailbox.&nbsp; This document will be reviewed by NIST staff or their delegates (who may request clarification or rewriting if documents are unclear or underspecified).&nbsp; Participants will receive &ldquo;certification&rdquo; that they have a basic understanding of differential privacy, or a brief explanation why their algorithm or proof are incorrect.&nbsp; An indicator will display on the leaderboard to all participants who have had their approach certified.</p>\n<p>- For participants with higher than normal scores for their specified epsilon and delta, the participant algorithm and code must be provided as often as requested by NIST staff or their delegates who will review for non-intentional mistakes. This is a courtesy to ensure the participant still qualifies for prize eligibility.</p>\n<p>- Certification status will be used in determining the provisional score for entries.</p>\n<p>- Only certified approaches are eligible for cash prizes (see rule \\#9, Final Review).</p>\n<p>9. Final Review:&nbsp; Before awarding cash prizes to participants who place in prize-winning ranks at the end of each Marathon Match, these participants must submit a report containing their complete algorithm description and mathematical privacy proof, along with their source code.&nbsp; They will have 7 days notification to provide this report.&nbsp; This report will be subject to a final review to verify that their algorithm correctly satisfies differential privacy at the stated values of delta and epsilon, and that the code correctly implements the stated algorithm.&nbsp; The review will be performed by Topcoder and NIST staff or their delegates, which may include NIST certified subject matter experts from outside NIST.&nbsp; If a participant is placed in a prize winning rank but fails to provide the report, or the review determines that their solution does not satisfy differential privacy, then they will not receive a prize, and it will be awarded to the participant with the next best performance who successfully completes the final review.</p>\n<p>10. An indicator will be present on the leaderboard to identify submissions with intention to publicly share their solutions at the end of the final match.&nbsp;Having this indicator will not increase or decrease participants&rsquo; chances of winning a prize.</p>\n<p>11. Relinquish - Topcoder/NIST is allowing registered participants or teams to &ldquo;relinquish&rdquo;.&nbsp; Government employees, students or any persons who are not allowed to take monetary prizes or feel they may have a conflict of interest are welcome to participate in the challenge while agreeing to forego the monetary prizes (by responding to the Relinquish post in the challenge forum).&nbsp; Relinquish means the member will compete, and their solutions scored, but they will not be eligible for a prize. Once a person or team relinquishes, we post their name to a forum thread labeled &ldquo;Relinquished Competitors&rdquo;.&nbsp;Members who relinquish must submit their implementation code and methods to maintain leaderboard status. Winners who are identified as relinquished will still be publicly recognized in the final winner announcements based on their placement on the leaderboard and the prize award, normally allotted to the placement of the relinquished team, will be given to the next certified team on the leaderboard. Throughout the challenge, the challenge&rsquo;s online leaderboard will display rankings and accomplishments, giving them various opportunities to have their work viewed and appreciated by stakeholders from industry, government and academic communities.</p>\n<p>12. All participants must register on the challenge platform, hosted by Topcoder as members.&nbsp; If they are already members, they must be in good standing (not banned or suspended).</p>\n<p>13. Teaming is allowed, participants are permitted to form teams for this competition. After forming a team, participants of the same team are permitted to collaborate with each other. To form a team, a Topcoder member may recruit other Topcoder members, and register the team by completing the Topcoder Teaming Form for this challenge. Each team must declare a Captain. All participants in a team must individually register for this Competition and accept Topcoder's Terms and Conditions prior to joining the team. Team Captains must apportion prize distribution percentages for each teammate on the Teaming Form. The sum of all prize portions must equal 100%. The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, the maximum permitted team size is 5 members. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Topcoder members participating in a team will not receive a rating for this Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team but is not the Captain of the team may be deleted and is ineligible for award. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 21st day following the date that Registration and Submission opens as shown on the Challenge Details page for each match. Topcoder will prepare a Teaming Agreement for each team that has completed the Topcoder Teaming Form and distribute it to each member of the team. Teaming Agreements must be electronically signed by each team member to be considered valid. All Teaming Agreements are void, unless electronically signed by all team members by 11:59pm ET of the 28th day following the date that Registration &amp; Submission opens as shown on the Challenge Details page. Any Teaming Agreement received after this period is void. Teaming Agreements may not be changed in any way after signature.&nbsp; The registered teams will be listed in the contest forum thread titled &ldquo;Registered Teams&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>14. Organizations such as companies may compete as one competitor if they are registered as a team and follow all challenge and platform rules.</p>\n<p>15. In this match participants may use any programming language and libraries, including commercial solutions, provided Topcoder/NIST are able to run it free of any charge. You may use open source languages and libraries provided they are equally free for your use, use by another competitor, or use by NIST. If your solution requires licenses, you must have these licenses and be able to legally install them in a testing VM (see &ldquo;Ways to Win:&nbsp; Final Prizes&rdquo; section). Submissions will be deleted/destroyed after they are confirmed. Topcoder/NIST will not purchase licenses to run your code.

Congratulations to them all!***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The Consumer Health Data Aggregator Challenge is intended to spur the development of third-party, consumer-facing applications that use open, standardized APIs to help consumers aggregate their data in one place and under their control. This challenge will focus on solving the problem that many consumers have today &ndash; the ability to easily and electronically access their health data from different health care providers using a variety of different health IT systems.</p>\n<p>The lack of interoperability between electronic health record (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to the modernization of health IT.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>&nbsp;(FHIR), developed by HL7, is a standard designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data. The FHIR API allows data to move between vendor systems at different providers and to third-party applications for direct use by consumers. The latter use case is key to enabling patients to play a more active role in managing their health. Patients&rsquo; ability to seamlessly take their data with them as they move from provider to provider is one of the main goals of moving from a paper-based to an electronic health record system.</p>\n<p>Of course, health and wellness information is not contained solely in provider systems - between wearables, sensors, smartphones, and more, a great deal of patient data is being collected by personal and at-home devices outside of clinical settings. An app that&nbsp;truly captures all of a consumer's health data must be able to absorb and consolidate all of this data being continuously collected, much of which is available through APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>***Watch the recording of the March 31&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB\">Informational Webinar</a>***&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who won Phase 1 &ndash; all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in Phase 1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2.&nbsp;The final application must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul> <li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard for Technical Use 2 (DSTU2)</li> <li>Aggregates all data as specified in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf\">Data column</a>)</li> <li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings. <ul> <li>There are two options to assess MU attestation here, by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Professionals.php\">Healthcare Professionals</a>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Hospitals.php\">Hospitals</a>. The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor &ndash; not Secondary EHR Vendor &ndash; in either of these reports.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Has been tested with patients and used in production settings</li> <li>Available to consumers through at least one of the following modes:&nbsp; mobile web, iOS Store, or Android Stores</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Participation Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The second phase, to run from&nbsp;June 2 to November 7, will entail the actual development of the apps, verification of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and public release of the apps. This will include remote testing with providers and health IT developers to test the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production systems. Participants will submit:</p>\n<ul> <li>Working app <ul> <li>Provide the url to download/access the app.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Video demonstrating the app (maximum of 5 minutes) <ul> <li>Provide the url of the video on YouTube or Vimeo.</li> <li>The video must highlight the use of FHIR to integrate with EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data exchange with each system. The rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation criteria:&nbsp; functionality and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of patient data, and user experience and visual appeal.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Slide deck describing app (maximum of 15 slides) <ul> <li>Overall, the slide deck should complement the video demonstration. It should include a list of the active FHIR integrations with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated in the video. It should describe other functionality pertaining to the review criteria, particularly anything that was not covered in the video.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n<p>The grand prize winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000. There will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest number of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings (the \"Ultimate Connector\"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize or 2nd place winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Participants interested in competing for Phase 1 awards will need to submit an app development plan that must include:</p>\n<ul> <li>Mockup/wireframes of the app <ul> <li>Provide a clear sense of the look, feel, and interactions of the app.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Technical specifications, including but not limited to planned data sources, system architecture, and compliance with HIPAA regulations (and other applicable law) <ul> <li>Provide a realistic idea of what data sources, and from who, will be included; how that data will be integrated together and in service to the consumer&rsquo;s needs; how data privacy and security will be implemented.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Business/sustainability plan <ul> <li>How does the submitter propose to enter the market and lead to a successful app? The plan should include the following:&nbsp; <ol> <li>Issue analysis, demonstrating understanding of the issue (1 page)</li> <li>Solution description, describing the solution and how it addresses the issues (2 pages)</li> <li>Financial estimates, including revenues and expenses (2 pages)</li> <li>Engagement plan, including targeted customer base and stakeholders (2 pages)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Provider partnership <ul> <li>Submitters are strongly encouraged to partner with a healthcare provider or EHR vendor for activities such as app development or pilot testing; evidence of partnership should be demonstrated with signed letters of intent on partner letterhead (i.e., we will not be reviewing actual business agreements).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n<p>To augment technical development and enhance the likelihood of a successful app that will continue to exist beyond the end of the challenge, a progress update/matchmaking event will be held that will seek to connect participants with provider partners. In Phase 1, up to five app proposals will be recognized as winners and awarded up to $15,000 each.</p>\n",

Congratulations to them all!</strong></p>\n<p>The Provider User-Experience (UX)&nbsp;Challenge incents&nbsp;the development of applications that use open, standardized APIs to enable innovative ways for providers to interact with patient health data. This challenge will focus on demonstrating how data made accessible to apps through APIs&nbsp;can positively impact providers&rsquo; experience with EHRs by making clinical workflows more intuitive, specific to clinical specialty, and actionable. The lack of interoperability between electronic health record (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to the modernization of health IT.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>&nbsp;(FHIR), developed by HL7, is a standard designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data. The FHIR API allows data to move between vendor systems both within and across different providers, not to mention through third-party applications for direct use by both clinicians and consumers. Among several opportunities now enabled by this interoperability standard are the new channels being opened up for improving a provider&rsquo;s user experience when interacting with EHRs and the &ldquo;consumability&rdquo; of interrelated health data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>***Watch the recording of the March 31&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Informational Webinar</a>***</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who won Phase 1 &ndash; all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in Phase 1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2.&nbsp;The final application must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul> <li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard for Technical Use 2 (DSTU2)</li> <li>Leverages&nbsp;data as specified in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data column</a>)</li> <li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings. There are two options to assess MU attestation here, by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Professionals.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthcare Professionals</a> or by <a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Hospitals.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hospitals</a>. The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor &ndash; not Secondary EHR Vendor &ndash; in either of these reports.</li> <li>Has been tested with users&nbsp;in production settings</li> <li>Available to providers&nbsp;through at least one of the following modes:&nbsp; direct from&nbsp;web, iOS Store, or Android Stores</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The second phase, to run from&nbsp;June 2 to November 7, will entail the actual development of the apps, verification of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and public release of the apps. This will include remote testing with providers and health IT developers to test the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production systems. Participants will submit:</p>\n<ul> <li>Working app:&nbsp; Provide the url to download/access the app.</li> <li>Video demonstrating the app (maximum of 5 minutes)</li> <ul> <li>Provide the url of the video on YouTube or Vimeo.</li> <li>The video must highlight the use of FHIR to integrate with EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data exchange with each system. The rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation criteria:&nbsp; functionality and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of patient data, impact potential in a clinical setting,&nbsp;and user experience and visual appeal.</li> </ul> <li>Slide deck describing app (maximum of 15 slides):&nbsp; Overall, the slide deck should complement the video demonstration. It should include a list of the active FHIR integrations with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated in the video. It should describe other functionality pertaining to the review criteria, particularly anything that was not covered in the video.</li> </ul>\n<p>The grand prize winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000. There will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest number of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings (the \"Ultimate Connector\"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize or 2nd place winner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Participants interested in competing for Phase 1 awards will need to submit an app development plan that must include:</p>\n<ul> <li>Mockup/wireframes of the app:&nbsp; Provide a clear sense of the look, feel, and interactions of the app.</li> <li>Technical specifications, including but not limited to planned data sources, system architecture, and compliance with HIPAA regulations (and other applicable law):&nbsp; Provide a realistic idea of what data sources, and from who, will be included; how that data will be integrated together and in service to the consumer&rsquo;s needs; how data privacy and security will be implemented.</li> <li>Business/sustainability plan:&nbsp; How does the submitter propose to enter the market and lead to a successful app? The plan should include the following:</li> <ol> <li>Issue analysis, demonstrating understanding of the issue (1 page)</li> <li>Solution description, describing the solution and how it addresses the issues (2 pages)</li> <li>Financial estimates, including revenues and expenses (2 pages)</li> <li>Engagement plan, including targeted customer base and stakeholders (2 pages)</li> </ol> <li>Provider partnership:&nbsp; Submitters are strongly encouraged to partner with a healthcare provider or EHR vendor for activities such as app development or pilot testing; evidence of partnership should be demonstrated with signed letters of intent on partner letterhead (i.e., we will not be reviewing actual business agreements).</li> </ul>\n<p>To augment technical development and enhance the likelihood of a successful app that will continue to exist beyond the end of the challenge, a progress update/matchmaking event will be held that will seek to connect participants with provider partners. In Phase 1, up to five app proposals will be recognized as winners and awarded up to $15,000 each.</p>\n",

These specifications empower people to control the authorization of access to health-related data sharing APIs.</p>\n<p>Participants are expected to engage people to test the implementation of the Solution and make possible processes that need consumers to authorize the release of their health data to a destination they choose. Participants must recruit individuals and obtain their authorizations to test the implementation of the Solution using their health data. The data for the API and Solution should be provided by Phase 2 finalists.</p>\n<p>The Challenge will have three phases and two finalists each winning $75,000. Phase 1 will award $5,000 for up 10 finalists each based on the proposals they submit to the Challenge. Phase 1 winners will move to Phase 2, which will award $20,000 for up to 5 finalists each based on the prototype of their Solution. Phase 2 winners will move to Phase 3, which will award $50,000 for up to two winners each based on the participant&rsquo;s ability to implement their Solution.</p>\n<p>This multi-phased approach allows participants to assemble, implement and test their Solutions. The final phase of the Challenge will require finalists to show a consumer-facing Solution that incorporates the HEART implementation specifications and uses an API that empowers consumers to control the movement of their health data.</p>\n<p>This Challenge encourages participants to apply independently or team with others including health IT developers, health care providers and other entities with the appropriate expertise related to this Solution. Lessons learned and the Challenge&rsquo;s results will be shared in order to support other organizations implementing solutions that make possible consumer-mediated exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Questions about the Move Health Data Forward Challenge can be posted to the Discussion section and will be regularly monitored.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 &ndash; Proposals&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The Proposal Phase allows participants to present Solutions that increase consumers&rsquo; access to and sharing of their information within electronic health record systems. In this phase, participants should describe the technical, operational, financial and business aspects of their proposed Solution.

Our response to the AMR Challenge is to produce a test that both confirms bacteremia caused by highly resistant strains, and provides a complete phenotypical antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) in a time that is radically shorter than today&rsquo;s clinical standard. The test employs a microfluidic sensor that counts and weighs individual microbes at high throughput, and robustly measures bacterial culture growth at a speed limited only by the growth of the microbes themselves. It will provide clinically actionable information - confirming the presence of highly resistant bacteria and identifying the best targeted therapies - in hours or even minutes, vs. the current standard of 2-3 days. The initial targets will be CRE and ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae, but the test will be extensible to all high-value bacterial targets and any desired antibiotics, and to a variety of bodily sources of infection (e.g., bacteremia/sepsis, spinal and pleural fluid, urinary tract, etc.) Because it assesses growth phenotypically, the test will not be defeated by evolving resistance mechanisms, and will provide an essential complement to resistance biomarkers and organism identification. The outcome will be the fastest possible sample-to result phenotypical susceptibility test, with the potential to migrate from a laboratory/in-patient setting to the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Becton, Dickinson and Company</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) seeks to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics by guiding healthcare practitioners in differentiating between bacterial and viral infections within the time constraints of a single outpatient visit. Building on the public-health utility and broad commercial success of the BD Veritor&trade; platform, we are developing a novel digital immunoassay (DIA) that will measure a panel of circulating host immune biomarkers from a single blood-based sample. The test is intended to be an aid in the management of patients with symptoms of infection &ndash; such as upper respiratory infection &ndash; for which antibiotic misuse is a widespread problem. By providing objective diagnostic evidence that the patient&rsquo;s immune system is fighting either a bacterial or a viral infection, the test will return an informative result without requiring a sample from the site of infection, and without the time or expense of diagnostic confirmation of numerous possible candidate pathogens. By employing the sample-in/result-out, one-button simplicity of the CLIA-waived BD Veritor system, the test can be deployed broadly at point-of-care settings without the need for trained personnel. And by returning a result rapidly (target of ten minutes) at the point of care, the test outcome will enable an actionable decision before the patient leaves the site.</p>\n<p><strong>Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, with 430--‐ 450 million cases and 3--‐ 4 million deaths per year. In the United States alone, there are 4--‐ 5 million CAP cases, 1.1 million hospitalizations, and over 52,000 deaths annually, accounting for over $34 billion in direct health expenditures. Despite the high incidence of CAP, existing diagnostic tests for CAP are inadequate, identifying an underlying microbial pathogen in only 7--‐ 38% of cases. Even when a specific causal pathogen is identified, results often return long after it is necessary to make a clinical treatment decision. Because of the difficulty of identifying the microbial cause of pneumonia and the potentially severe consequences of not treating bacterial pneumonia promptly, clinicians often treat CAP empirically with antibiotics, even though a large proportion of these cases are viral in etiology. Unnecessary broad--‐ spectrum antibiotic prescriptions per year, in turn, fuel the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, including most of the urgent and serious threat level pathogens on the Center for</p>\n<p><strong>Click Diagnostics, Inc.</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Click Diagnostics was founded with the mission to dramatically improve health outcomes through innovative new diagnostic technology providing physicians with &ldquo;patient-side&rdquo; test results enabling immediate and accurate treatment. Through dramatic miniaturization, optimization, and cost reduction of laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, we have created a fast, inexpensive, easy-to-use, single-use (disposable) diagnostic device. Think &ldquo;home pregnancy test,&rdquo; but for nearly &ldquo;any infectious disease.&rdquo; Click has made patient-side testing for infectious diseases almost as simple as taking a patient&rsquo;s blood pressure. We expect this to revolutionize health testing, moving molecular testing from laboratories and large healthcare facilities to doctors&rsquo; offices and clinics, and eventually the home. Because the Click device is fundamentally a PCR assay, products can be developed for most common infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted infections (STI), hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and respiratory infections. Our first product for detecting the STIs gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis is scheduled for clinical trial in 2017. As part of the AMR challenge, we plan to add a test for drug resistant gonorrhea to this panel. The CDC identifies drug resistant gonorrhea as an urgent threat due to high levels of drug resistance and potential impact on public health (1).</p>\n<p><strong>Duke University</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Inappropriately prescribed antibacterials for viral respiratory illness contribute to increased healthcare costs, unnecessary drug-related adverse effects, and drive antimicrobial resistance. The inability to rapidly and reliably distinguish bacterial from viral or non-infectious etiologies is a major impediment to appropriate antibiotic use. Pathogen detection strategies can be helpful but are limited by poor sensitivity, long time-to-result, inability to distinguish infection from colonization, or restricted number of target pathogens. Peptide biomarkers such as procalcitonin may also be helpful but are poorly sensitive and specific. Consequently, these approaches have not adequately addressed the antibacterial overuse problem. We therefore propose an innovative solution focusing on the patient&rsquo;s response to infection. New scientific advances can now capture the entirety of the host response using system-wide molecular surveys (e.g., RNA, proteins, metabolites). We have developed analytical methods to define the stereotyped responses found within these highly complex and dense data. Applying these techniques to infection, we have shown the pattern of immune system response can distinguish bacterial, viral, and non-infectious etiologies. That response is most robustly detected in the patient&rsquo;s gene expression profile, which is far more accurate than existing diagnostic tests. This strategy is only useful, however, if it can be measured rapidly, simply, and at the point-of-need. Supported by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group, Duke University and BioFire Diagnostics now propose such a test. This simple-to-use, 1-hour test distinguishes bacterial infection, viral infection, or neither so as to guide the appropriate administration of antibacterials at the point-of-need.</p>\n<p><strong>First Light Biosciences, Inc.</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>First Light Biosciences is addressing two critical issues in healthcare:&nbsp; the rise in superbugs that are re-sistant to most antibiotics and the epidemic of hospital acquired infections. Today, a large fraction of life threatening infections seen in hospitals are caused by pathogens that are resistant to multiple anti-biotics. Effective treatment and cure requires rapid diagnostics to detect infections and select appropri-ate antibiotics for treatment. Unfortunately, no such tests exist today. We propose to develop tests based on First Light&rsquo;s MultiPath technology that can rapidly and affordably detect a broad range of in-fections, accurately identify the infectious agents, and determine the appropriate antibiotic for treat-ment. The MultiPath platform consists of an automated benchtop analyzer that accommodates a broad menu of application-specific consumable cartridges. The MultiPath technology is quantitative. In only 15 min it detects infections and identifies pathogens including bacteria, fungi, viruses, toxins, human cells, and biomarkers. The technology can determine the correct antibiotic therapy in just 4 hours in contrast to the several days required by current methods. While as sensitive as high performance cen-tral laboratory tests, the MultiPath tests are as rapid and as easy-to-use as point-of-care tests and re-quire no sample preparation. The proprietary MultiPath technology achieves high sensitivity and quan-tification by using digital non-magnified imaging to count fluorescently labeled cellular and molecular targets. The MultiPath Platform eliminates labile enzymatic reagents, biochemical purification, and liq-uid handling (including wash steps), reducing complexity and cost while increasing throughput. We pro-pose to develop high-performance easy-to-use tests for important diagnostic applications for initial commercialization in the hospital setting. The platform and tests will also have commercial and medical advantages in outpatient settings. For Step 2, we plan to:&nbsp; (1) develop MultiPath assays for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) diagnostics, multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance, and urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostics, (2) develop the MultiPath consumable cartridges for the three tests, (3) develop the benchtop automated MultiPath Analyzer, and (4) demonstrate the performance of the integrated MultiPath Analyzer and MultiPath Tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Philips North America</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Neutrophil Lipocalin (HNL) on a diagnostic platform from a single drop of human blood. In 2015 the concept was successfully demonstrated with blood samples from patients with acute fever where in only minutes patients with a bacterial infection could clearly be distinguished from those without. To make this marker available in the primary care setting, Philips is working to realize the whole blood based assay onto its Minicare system. The CE-marked Minicare system is a platform for rapid blood testing, consisting of a point-of-care analyser and cartridges supporting different types of tests. Finalization of product development is estimated at 2.5 - 3 years. Penn will confirm performance of the biomarker using U.S. clinical samples in a separate study. Once test development is complete, Penn will serve as the clinical study site to validate and register the test and to perform a health technology assessment measuring its impact in reducing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Spectral Labs, Inc.</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>We propose InSpector-01 (~ a rapid test for characterizing the presence/absence of pathogenic microorganisms in blood and urine samples) and InSpector-02 (~ a rapid test for characterizing the functional MIC minimum inhibitory concentration of a candidate antimicrobial required to suppress the growth of the causative pathogen, even prior to that pathogen being isolated and identified). InSpector-01 would be used to test blood and urine samples, both in the outpatient and in the inpatient setting, and would identify patients for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate. Thus, InSpector-01 can reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use for the vast majority of patients who are currently treated with antimicrobials, but who are uninfected. InSpector-02 would be used to characterize blood samples in the inpatient setting for the functional MIC of the causative pathogen, so as to guide subsequent antimicrobial therapy (from the 2nd antimicrobial dose on). Both InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 offer unique capabilities ~ we are not aware of any other current/emerging methods that can identify patients for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate (as InSpector-01 does) or current/emerging methods that can provide the functional MIC (as InSpector-02 does; other methods provide markers of specific resistance mechanisms). Both InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 are at an advanced stage of development, and are currently being field tested to develop a quality system necessary for distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>University of Rochester</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>More accurate tests for microbiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are needed. Acute respiratory infections occur commonly throughout life, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality in adults, and these infections are a leading cause of antibiotic overuse. Unnecessary antibiotic use is a major driver of the increase in antimicrobial resistance, which is considered to be one of the most urgent threats to global public health. In most cases of ARI, the precise microbial etiology is unknown and antibiotics are administered empirically in illness in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Although sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allow clinicians to rapidly and accurately diagnose a wide variety of respiratory viruses, their impact on patient management and antibiotic prescription has been modest primarily due to concern about bacterial co-infection. Sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for bacterial lung infection are currently lacking. Clinical parameters such as fever, purulent sputum, white blood cell count and radiographic patterns do not provide sufficient precision to reliably distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Thus, &ldquo;ruling out&rdquo; bacterial respiratory infection is extremely difficult, resulting in a default position of prescribing antibiotics to almost all patients hospitalized with respiratory infection and many outpatients as well. This practice results in significant antibiotic overuse, with resultant adverse effects and increased antimicrobial resistance. Recently, serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin have shown some promise as a supplement to clinical judgment in assessing patients with ARI but a need for more accurate tests remains. Gene expression profiling of whole blood represents a powerful new approach for analysis of the host response during infection. Preliminary studies indicate that viruses and bacteria may trigger specific host transcriptional patterns in blood, yielding unique &ldquo;bio-signatures&rdquo; that may discriminate viral from bacterial causes of infection. This approach can be used to supplement pathogen detection allowing clinicians to target antibiotic use for those patients that need treatment and thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant antimicrobial resistance. New rapid molecular diagnostics that incorporate detection of common respiratory viruses and bacteria combined with a limited number host genes discriminatory for bacterial and viral infection will be developed. The eventual goal is to simplify testing such that point of care ARI diagnostics can be employed in hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics and physicians&rsquo; offices for the maximal impact on patient care and antibiotic prescription.</p>\n<p><strong>Yale University</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Every year, citizens of the United States experience more than one billion infections of the upper respiratory tract. Both viruses and bacteria can cause these illnesses but only bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics. However, we do not have a simple, rapid, comprehensive diagnostic test to distinguish between viral and bacterial upper respiratory infections. Lack of such tests contributes to the fact that outpatient visits for acute respiratory infection are the most common setting for inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S, with about half of these prescriptions (~35 million prescriptions annually) not indicated1. Our recent findings indicate a way to develop a diagnostic test to rapidly distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory illness while the patient is in the doctor&rsquo;s office. Unlike current tests, which detect the presence of specific viruses, this approach measures the response of the patient&rsquo;s airway cells to the infection to indicate whether the body is fighting a viral infection or a bacterial infection. This approach has two major advantages over current approaches:&nbsp; (1) many different viruses and bacteria can cause similar respiratory symptoms, but the only tests currently available are pathogen-specific. Therefore a single test can easily miss the organism causing the patient&rsquo;s illness, and testing for large panels of pathogens is complex and can be prohibitively expensive; (2) unlike other proposed approaches to distinguish viral and bacterial infections based on the body&rsquo;s response, our approach does not require a blood sample, but will work with a nose or throat swab. This test has tremendous potential to transform ingrained practices of prescribing antibiotics for non-bacterial illnesses by demonstrating the cause of infection to physician and patient during the initial healthcare encounter, and therefore will provide a powerful tool for promoting antimicrobial stewardship.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Did you know that every year the Federal government&nbsp;invests over $135 billion in research and development? Almost one-third of these funds support intramural research - by Federal researchers within Federal laboratories - covering a wide range of technologies with applications in aerospace, biotechnology, chemical engineering, communications, electronics, and much, much more. Many of the technologies developed by Federal researchers are transferred to the private sector through formal agreements (e.g. patents, licenses, or cooperative research and development agreements) or through informal exchanges (e.g. publications, conference presentations or collaborations).&nbsp;Without doubt these Federal investments have yielded extraordinary long-term impacts, creating new knowledge and ultimately new industries. But we need more efforts to quantify these impacts. How can we most accurately and completely capture the economic and societal impact&nbsp;of federal technology transfer activities?&nbsp;This challenge calls on you to analyze a federally-developed technology that has been transferred to the private sector, and present the results in a paper suitable for an archival publication.</p>\n<p><strong>Why this Challenge?</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the proliferation of Federal research and the profound effect that many Federally-developed technologies have upon our everyday life, more effort is needed&nbsp;to assess the impact of these technologies -- as emphasized in President Obama's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/28/presidential-memorandum-accelerating-technology-transfer-and-commerciali\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2011 Memorandum Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses</a>. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Journal of Technology Transfer aim to stimulate efforts in this area through this Challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a Federally developed technology?</strong></p>\n<p>Eligible technologies for this Challenge must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology must have been developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the course of their employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the technology must have been transferred in a manner that can be traced back to the agency.&nbsp;Information about federally transferred technologies and technology transfer success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href=\"http://www.federallabs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.federallabs.org</a>. &nbsp; See&nbsp;a list of Federal agencies that prepare annual <a href=\"http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technology transfer reports</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I assess one?</strong></p>\n<p>The objective of this Challenge is to identify and measure economic and societal impacts&nbsp;that result from the transfer of&nbsp;Federally developed technologies.</p>\n<ul> <li>First, &nbsp;identify a technology that was developed in a Federal agency. Information about federally transferred technologies can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href=\"http://www.federallabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.federallabs.org</a> as well as individual Federal agency websites, including NIST's <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technology Partnerships Office</a>. NIST provides&nbsp;a <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo/agency-technology-transfer-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of Federal agencies that issue annual technology transfer reports</a>.</li> <li>Next, research the impact of this technology by examining&nbsp;who is using the technology,&nbsp;how they are using it, and what impacts have resulted from its use.&nbsp; Impacts may be assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic data or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security).</li> <li>Finally,&nbsp;prepare an original paper describing your research and the impact that you have identified. Your paper should clearly describe the technology you are assessing and include evidence of how it has been used since being transferred. &nbsp;Note that a variety of assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this Challenge including, but not limited to, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo/nist-economic-impact-studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIST's economic impact studies</a> and these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo/other-agency-economic-impact-studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">examples of commonly used approaches</a>.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Who should participate?</strong></p>\n<p>This Challenge is open to anyone (or any organization) that meets the eligibility requirements described in the Rules. You do not need to be a technology expert or economist,&nbsp;but you should have an appetite for research and some familiarity with methods of impact analysis. Teaming is encouraged because of the scope and diversity of potential technology transfer studies, from understanding the technology to tracking its transfer&nbsp;and assessing its impact.</p>\n<p><strong>To enter:</strong></p>\n<p>Submit a research paper that identifies a federally developed technology and analyzes the economic or social or economic impact that occurred as a result of it being transferred outside of the federal agency in which it was developed.&nbsp; If your paper is selected as a winner, you will receive a $5,000 cash award and you will be invited to have your paper considered for publication in&nbsp;<em>The Journal of Technology Transfer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you begin,&nbsp;carefully review the Rules to make sure you are eligible to Participate and for more details&nbsp;about&nbsp;the Challenge.

In an effort to encourage research in this area, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the <em>Journal of Technology Transfer</em> present a Federal Impact Assessment (FIA) Challenge for researchers to develop impact studies of Federal technology transfer activities. The FIA Challenge calls on researchers to perform original retrospective studies that assess the impact of federally developed technologies that 1) have been developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) have been transferred to an entity other than the agency which developed the technology.</p>\n<p><strong>DATES:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><em>Submission Period:&nbsp; </em>September 27, 2016 -&nbsp;March 31, 2017</p>\n<p><em>Announcement of Winners:&nbsp; </em>April 28, 2017</p>\n<p>The Submission Period begins September 27,&nbsp;2016, at 9:00 AM Eastern Time (ET) and ends March 31, 2017, at 5:00 PM ET.&nbsp; Prize competition dates are subject to change at the discretion of NIST. &nbsp;Entries submitted before or after the Submission Period will not be reviewed or considered for award. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>FOR </strong><strong>FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Changes or updates to the prize competition rules will be posted and can be viewed at the Event Website, <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge</a>.</p>\n<p>Questions about the prize competition can be directed to NIST via the Event Website&nbsp;or by email to Michael Walsh at michael.walsh@nist.gov, phone 301-975-5455.</p>\n<p>Results of the prize competition will be announced on the Event Website&nbsp;and on the NIST website, www.nist.gov. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FIA Challenge Sponsors</strong></p>\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov\">www.nist.gov</a>) is a non-regulatory Federal agency within the United States Department of Commerce.

Any individuals or legal entities that have received Federal funds for the development of any part of a submission are ineligible.&nbsp; Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of the FIA Challenge, are also not eligible to participate.</p>\n<p>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the FIA Challenge if the employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis. &nbsp;Note that while Federal employees may provide information to Participants they are not obligated to respond to information requests within the time frame of this Challenge. The task of gathering information for this Challenge in a timely manner is the sole responsibility of the Participant.</p>\n<p>To be eligible to win a Cash Award, a Participant (whether an individual or legal entity) must have registered to participate and must have complied with all requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code (&ldquo;Prize competitions&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Multiple entries are permitted. &nbsp;Each entry will be reviewed independently. &nbsp;Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a group to submit a single entry, in which case all members of the group must satisfy the eligibility requirements, and a single individual from the group must be designated as an official representative for each entry.&nbsp; That designated individual will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. &nbsp;Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations.&nbsp; Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Entry Process for Participants</strong></p>\n<p>To enter, visit the Event Website, <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge</a>. Submit a Federal Impact Assessment (hereafter, &ldquo;Paper&rdquo;) that meets the selection criteria described below.</p>\n<p>The FIA Challenge calls on Participants to write an original Paper describing a retrospective assessment of the economic and/or societal impacts resulting from the transfer of a Federal technology developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at any time over the past 30 years.</p>\n<p>For this FIA Challenge, &ldquo;Federal technologies&rdquo; are those techniques, machines, articles of manufacture, compositions of matter, methods, processes, tools, or works of authorship, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, that were invented or developed in whole or in part by one or more Federal employees during the course of their employment duties.</p>\n<p>Transfer of a Federal technology (technology transfer) is the use of that technology by an entity outside of the agency where the Federal employee(s) was assigned.&nbsp; There are many different means by which the Federal government seeks to transfer technologies. Technologies can be transferred through formal agreements (e.g., licenses, or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements) or through informal exchanges (e.g., publications, conference presentations or informal collaborations).</p>\n<p>Eligible technologies must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology must have been developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the course of his or her employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the technology must have been transferred outside the Federal agency in a manner that can be traced back to that Federal agency. Technologies that have been developed entirely outside of a Federal agency or that have been developed entirely by non-Federal employees (even though with federal funding) are not eligible. Technologies that have not been transferred by a Federal agency are also not eligible.&nbsp; Information about federally transferred technologies and technology transfer success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href=\"http://www.federallabs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.federallabs.org</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;For a list of Federal agencies that prepare annual technology transfer reports, see <a href=\"http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm</a>.</p>\n<p>For the FIA Challenge, it is envisioned that impacts of a given Federal technology(ies) are determined by an assessment of repercussions that have accrued to those who have either utilized Federal technologies in research or development activities, and/or consumed goods or services enabled by Federal technologies.&nbsp; The objective of the FIA Challenge is to develop metrics that measure economic and societal impacts. These metrics will then be available to stakeholders and policy makers to evaluate the net impact of federally developed technologies (i.e., impact less development costs).<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp; Impacts may be assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic data or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security).&nbsp; A variety of assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this Challenge.&nbsp; Examples of commonly used approaches can be found in the citations provided by NIST online at <a href=\"http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/other-economic-impact-related-studies.cfm\">http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/other-economic-impact-related-studies.cfm</a>.</p>\n<p>Papers submitted to this challenge that have previously been published or that have been prepared using Federal funds are not eligible (e.g., Federal agency reports, reports prepared by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, or reports prepared by funded intermediaries on behalf of Federal agencies.)</p>\n<p>A complete Entry includes your Paper (including any figures, tables, and references), the email address of the Participant who is officially representing the Entry, and confirmation that you have read and agree to the Competition Rules contained in this Notice. &nbsp;Participants may provide submissions beginning at 9:00 AM ET on September&nbsp;27<sup>th</sup>, 2016, to the Event Website.&nbsp; Submission can be made no later than 5:00 PM ET on March 31, 2017, to the Event Website. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Submissions before the start date and time, or after the end date and time, will not be evaluated or considered for award.&nbsp; Entries sent to NIST in any manner other than through the Event Website will not be evaluated or considered for award.&nbsp; Entries that do not comply with the formatting requirements set forth in this Notice will not be evaluated or considered for award.</p>\n<p>Entries must be complete, must contain no confidential information and must be in English.</p>\n<p>In general, each Entry:</p>\n<p>a) must affirmatively represent that the Participant (and each Participant if more than one) has read and consents to be governed by the Competition rules and meets the eligibility requirements;</p>\n<p>b) must include an original Paper not prepared using Federal funds. Specifically, the Paper must:</p>\n<ol> <li>include the author(s) and the name and email address of the official representative,</li> <li>include text, figures, tables and references that describes a retrospective impact assessment of a federally developed technology(ies),</li> <li>be an original work not previously published in any media (i.e., including but not limited to printed or otherwise reproduced text/graphics for sale or distribution to the public),</li> <li>be a single file submitted in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format with text, figures, tables, and references contained within the Paper. There is no page limit,</li> <li>provide an assessment of the economic and/or societal impacts of a technology or technologies that have been developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at any time over the past 30 years, and must have been transferred from a Federal agency,</li> <li>provide a complete description of the impact methodology, including a description of the metrics used for the impact assessment. Citations of Federal technologies must be provided, for example by listing patent numbers, as well as citations of the transfer of the technologies to the private sector, for example by listing products and companies using licensed Federal technologies,</li> <li>meet the Evaluation Criteria described below in the Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s) sections, and</li> <li>include original figures, tables, and text passages or, if any of these have been published elsewhere, Participants must have obtained written permission, at Participants&rsquo; sole expense, from the copyright owner(s) for both the irrevocable use and distribution by NIST of the figure, tables, or text passages, in both print and online formats and evidence that such permission has been granted must be provided in the Paper. Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to originate from the authors;</li> </ol>\n<p>c) must include in a separate section on the title page of the Paper, an acknowledgement of any individuals, grants, funds, or other entities that provided support for the Paper.

The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website and published in the Federal Register.&nbsp; The Prize Purse will be used to fund one or more awards.</p>\n<p>NIST will announce via the Event Website any Entry(ies) as to which the Judges have made a cash award (each, an &ldquo;Award&rdquo;).&nbsp; The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in this Federal Register Notice; however, the Judges are not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserve the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Entries meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on the Judges' evaluation of the quality of Entries and in their sole discretion.&nbsp; Awards will be made based on the Judges&rsquo; evaluation of an Entry&rsquo;s compliance with the Judging Criteria for this Competition.&nbsp; All potential winners will be notified by the e-mail address provided in the submission document and may be required to complete further documentation confirming their eligibility.&nbsp; Return of any notification as &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo; will result in disqualification.&nbsp; After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of a check or electronic funds transfer addressed to the official representative specified in the winning Entry.&nbsp; That official representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.&nbsp; Each list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>\n<p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>\n<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Submission Evaluation Criteria </em></p>\n<p>This section discusses how Participant submissions will be evaluated.</p>\n<p><em>Entry Submission and Review</em></p>\n<p>The requirements for submission of a complete Entry are detailed in the section &ldquo;Entry Process for Participants.&rdquo; &nbsp;Each Paper will be reviewed by up to three subject matter experts.&nbsp; Each subject matter expert will assess how well the Paper addressed each of the following evaluation criteria. For each criterion, subject matter experts will assign a numerical score and will provide a brief (50 to 100 word) assessment of how well that criterion was met.</p>\n<p><em>Evaluation Criteria</em></p>\n<ol> <li>Description of the technology. (20 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must include a description of the technology being analyzed. In addition to describing the function and purpose of the technology, the description must also identify where and when the technology was developed, when the technology was transferred, and how the technology was transferred. Papers will be evaluated based on the presentation of a clear and adequate description of the technology being assessed.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\"> <li>Description of the demand environment. (30 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must include a description of the demand environment. The demand environment is the environment in which the technology is utilized after it has been transferred from the agency. Papers should describe the types and number of individuals and/or organizations that utilize the technology.&nbsp; This should include researchers, consumers, and companies that make up the markets and industries affected. Papers will be evaluated based on the presentation of a clear and adequate description of the demand environment.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\"> <li>Description of methodologies used to gather and assess impact data. (20 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must include a description of how impact data was gathered and assessed. This includes a description of all data sources, techniques used to clean, adjust or normalize data, and statistical methods employed.&nbsp; Papers will be evaluated based on the creativity and appropriateness of the methodology used to gather data and assess impacts.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\"> <li>Description of the economic and/or societal impacts that resulted from the technology transferred from the Federal agency. (30 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must describe the economic and/or societal impact that resulted from the utilization of the technology once transferred from the agency. The description must be based on the evidence gathered and the statistical method(s) used to assess impacts in the demand environment. The description must include clearly defined metrics that allow for the benchmarking of impacts over time. Papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which reported impacts are presented in an accurate, unbiased, comprehensive, and convincing manner.</p>\n<p>Up to 15 Papers will be selected for evaluation by the Judges. Selected papers will be the lesser of either (1) all papers with an average subject matter expert score of 70 or higher, or (2) the top 15 papers with the highest average subject matter expert scores.</p>\n<p>A panel of three judges will then be convened to rank the selected Papers. Judges will review each of the selected Papers and the corresponding reviews provided by subject matter experts. Judges will deliberate and then rank them using the following <strong>equally weighted</strong> Judging Criteria.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Novelty of the Approach</strong> &ndash; The extent to which each Paper describes a new, creative, or innovative approach to capturing the impact of a Federally funded technology(ies).</li> <li><strong>Scope of the Assessment</strong> &ndash; The extent to which each Paper addresses the scope of impact from the transfer of a Federally funded technology.</li> <li><strong>Quality of the Paper</strong> &ndash; The extent to which each Paper present a high-quality, well-reasoned and compelling argument for capturing the impact of a federal funded technology(ies).</li> </ul>\n<p>Participant(s) who submitted a Paper that is among the top four Papers ranked by the Judges will receive $5,000 and an invitation to have the Paper considered for publication in a special issue of<em> The Journal of Technology Transfer</em> (&ldquo;Journal&rdquo;), or another issue as determined by the Journal&rsquo;s editorial board. Participants accepting this invitation who submit their Paper to the Journal must comply with the Journal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Instructions for Authors.&rdquo; (See:<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/journal/10961\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/journal/10961</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers submitted will be peer-reviewed using the processes of the Journal, and acceptance for publication is wholly within the Journal&rsquo;s discretion, and is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p><em>Subject Matter Experts and Judging Panel</em></p>\n<p>Subject Matter Experts, to be selected by NIST, will, as a body, represent a high degree of experience with impact assessment and federally funded technologies. Subject Matter Experts will consist of Federal employees and will be subject matter experts in the technology field. Subject Matter Experts will not select winners of any awards.</p>\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of highly qualified Judges. The Judging Panel will consist of three individuals who are experts in the field of assessing economic or societal impacts. Judges will deliberate and rank Papers&nbsp;according to the Judging Criteria described above. The top four Papers&nbsp;ranked by the Judges will be selected to receive an Award. Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in this Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant.

The Grand Prize winner was selected from the three initial finalists&nbsp;by a panel of 12 users. We have also included additional acknowledgements for the teams that provided the best and the most unique graphical user interfaces (these results have also been posted on the OIG website at <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/\">https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Prize Winner and Finalist:&nbsp; Doug Brown (Team Catalyst) </strong></p>\n<p>Overall, Team Catalyst's entry delivered the most intuitive user experience. The entry maintained the familiarity of the original RAT-STATS design while still finding room to add several new and useful features. For example, the entry included custom confidence intervals which allowed users to calculate confidence intervals at other than the standard 80, 90, or 95 percent confidence levels. The entry went beyond the 4 modules required by the contest and included functions for stratified attribute samples and for generating sets of random numbers. As with the other finalists, the Team Catalyst entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Finalist:&nbsp; Murray Miron </strong></p>\n<p>Among a number of notable new features, Murray's entry included an integrated help system that connected relevant help information with each input element within the software. The accessibility of the information greatly reduced the need for users to refer back to a separate help screen or manual. Murray's entry also included the fastest algorithm for calculating exact confidence intervals for large attribute samples. In addition, the entry went beyond the four required modules to also include a function for determining the sample size of a design given an estimated error rate. As with the other finalists, Murray's entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Finalist:&nbsp; Dave&nbsp;Kaniss and Tim Kaniss (Team ENGRdynamics) </strong></p>\n<p>Team ENGRdyanmics' simplified the original RAT-STATS Design by combining the stratified and unrestricted variable appraisal functions into a single module. The combined module had an elegant design and was still very effective in accounting for the differences between the stratified and unrestricted analyses. The team also included a number of additional useful new features such as the ability to import files by dragging them into the target input field. &nbsp;As with the other finalists, the Team ENGRdynamics' entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Graphical User Interface - Corey Berry and Aja Berry (Team CBTek)</strong></p>\n<p>The graphical user interface for CBTek's entry looked great, met 508 compliance standards, and allowed for easy access to all key program functions and operations. The interface had the added advantage that it was customizable to fit the needs of the individual user. Of final note, the team's splash screen and program icon were the best of all the entries submitted.</p>\n<p><strong>Graphic User Interface Honorable Mention &ndash; Sudeep Shouche and Premraj Narkhede (Team Dolcera)</strong></p>\n<p>Team Dolcera provided a unique entry which split several of the RAT-STATS modules into a series of steps. The component nature of the design simplified the input and made the function requirements easier to follow for new users.</p>\n<p><strong>Contest Rules and Description</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;Once five finalists have been identified, no further entries from teams not previously identified as finalists will be reviewed even if they are submitted prior to the May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST deadline.&nbsp; Moreover, the contest will end on May 15, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. EST even if fewer than five finalists have been selected.</p>\n<p>Finalists may update their entries without losing their finalist designation.

The newest entry from each team will be used for all judging purposes unless otherwise requested by the team.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Status:</strong>&nbsp;Status as of 3:00&nbsp;PM EST&nbsp;May&nbsp;31 2017:&nbsp;Three finalists.</p>\n<p><strong>Registration:</strong>&nbsp;To register for the competition, create an account on the&nbsp;challenge.gov website and send an email with the name(s) of your team member(s) to jared.smith@oig.hhs.gov.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp;Each year HHS handles hundreds of millions of Medicare and Medicaid claims valued at over a trillion dollars. Due to the high volume of claims, statistical sampling provides a critical tool to ensure effective oversight of these expenditures. Sampling is used by the providers in their own efforts to monitor their performance and by the various organizations within HHS. There are a wide range of different software tools for performing statistical analysis. RAT-STATS has a unique niche in that it provides a straightforward tool for individuals who need a simple but robust method for selecting and analyzing statistical samples. The RAT-STATS software was originally created in 1978 and has gone through several upgrades since that time. Unlike a full statistical package that attempts to answer all types of questions for a wide range of users, RAT-STATS serves as a streamlined solution to handle the specific task of developing valid statistical samples and estimates within the healthcare oversight setting.</p>\n<p>For example, an OIG investigator may pull a simple random sample in order to estimate damages for a provider suspected of fraud. RAT-STATS generates valid pseudo-random numbers and outputs all of the information needed to replicate the sample. Once the investigator finishes reviewing the sample, he or she can then enter the results into RAT-STATS to get the final statistical estimate. While the investigator may need some basic training in statistics, he or she would not need the same level of expertise as would be required to navigate the many options available in a full service statistical or data analysis package.</p>\n<p>The objective of the current challenge is to develop the foundation for an upgraded version of RAT-STATS. The current version of RAT-STATS is well validated; however, its user interface can be difficult to navigate and the underlying code makes the software costly to update. OIG needs a new, modern version of the software that is easy to use and can be extended in a cost effective manner. In addition, the new version of the software must be 508 compliant.</p>\n<p>The current version of the RAT-STATS software can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000101/http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp\">http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp</a>.</p>\n",

To keep up, the National Science Foundation (NSF)&nbsp;plans to invest in its most critical resource &ndash; the workforce. And it's not just NSF. The need for an adaptable and ready workforce extends to other Federal agencies and beyond. No industry will be immune to the way advances in technology change the nature of work. As a pressing example, we are facing critical gaps in matching people with data science and cybersecurity skills with the right mission needs. NSF believes that, along with other agencies and organizations, the best way to maintain a workforce ready to carry out its mission is to encourage a culture of continuous learning, and to empower each person to refresh and modernize their skills toward future work. We want to spark the thinking of the best and brightest to co-create a solution that can enable individual skill-matching and tailored training for the Workforce for the 21st Century.</p> <p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Future-Federal-Workforce.png\" width=\"742\" height=\"513\" alt=\"challenge vision for the future\" /></p> <p><strong><em>NSF has a vision.</em></strong></p> <p>Imagine a mechanism that rapidly enables an individual to match their skills and interests to current and future work opportunities, leveraging advanced technologies which incorporate learning and development needs (traditional, non-traditional, and experiential), and that provides direct access to options for obtaining the relevant expertise to ready the individual for the chosen work.&nbsp;</p> <p>The future world of work may not be recognizable yet, however a ready workforce will remain critical for both economic prosperity and mission accomplishment.&nbsp; Employers must start now to instill a culture of continuous learning in its most critical resource, the workforce. To do this, we must think creatively about broadening the pool of available candidates by lowering the barriers for access to opportunities. This journey begins with a mechanism that enables individuals to self-select and prepare for chosen work that complements their skills and interests. The future of work is one of continuous change, which depends on a culture of continuous learning.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>COMPETITION AIMS</strong></p> <p>This Career Compass Challenge is part of an effort to modernize the American workforce, but in order to do that we are focusing on the National Science Foundation as a model. This Challenge will address the changing nature of work, and the pace of change to the types of work, needed to carry out essential missions for the American people and create the Workforce for the 21st Century, starting with NSF. At the conclusion of this Challenge, NSF hopes to have created a \"market\" for technology solutions that will help employees plot a path for changing careers or identify how to move forward in their current career path, while also facilitating continuous reskilling.</p> <p>Moreover, the Career Compass Challenge will help inform further collaborative, cross-sector innovation that Federal agencies are pursuing more broadly, such as through the <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Government Effectiveness Advanced Research&mdash;or GEAR&mdash;Center</a>. The GEAR Center will facilitate applied research to tackle management challenges at the Executive Branch enterprise level, confronting shared issues like workforce reskilling that cut across Federal agencies and other stakeholders. To the extent that this Career Compass Challenge is intended to explore creating a culture of a continuously ready workforce, on a small scale for NSF&mdash;by leveraging thought leaders across the American public, academia and industry&mdash;this challenge may be a model for learning how to successfully tackle other broad opportunities through a crowdsourced, test and learn model.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>We want to hear from you!</em></strong></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s explore innovative ways to expose opportunities for NSF employees, within NSF, across Federal Agencies, and even beyond the Government. Let's be creative about leveraging training methods that are broadly accessible and that empower each person to ready themselves to take advantage of available opportunities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can you help us figure out a way to meet the workforce &ldquo;where they are at&rdquo;? Can you propose a solution available to anyone, at any time, from any device, in any location, and from any economic or educational background? Think NSF first, and then think beyond.&nbsp; This challenge is broadly applicable and the outcomes should be scalable.</p> <p><strong>COMPETITION OVERVIEW</strong></p> <p>The different types of roles and opportunities the Government offers the Federal workforce are more diverse than they have ever been, and the way federal staff work is changing. Federal employees no longer stay on a linear career path in the same field for most of their careers. Instead, many employees are branching out by making lateral moves into different fields. In addition, the pace of changes to the types of work that employees do, largely because of the ever-changing pace of technology, has increased dramatically over the past few years. It is difficult for agencies to identify and provide training for the workforce at the same rate of those changes. And it's likely that the Federal Government is not alone.</p> <p><em><strong>Part 1 (November 9, 2018 &ndash; February 13, 2019)</strong></em></p> <p>In <em>Part 1</em> of this challenge, solvers were asked to submit a concept white paper that describes a solution to the challenge of continuous workforce reskilling and the desire for increased mobility within and between NSF and other Federal agencies (and perhaps even the private sector), as an example. Solvers were asked to think creatively about methods that go beyond the traditional \"career path\" thinking and \"strategic workforce planning\" methodology when exposing future skill needs or opportunities for an individual's consideration when choosing a development path. Solvers are also asked to consider relevant research on adult cognition and reskilling, particularly for those that must \"work\" and \"learn\" simultaneously. Read the winning submissions in the PRIZES section.</p> <p><em><strong>Part 2 (April 15, 2019 - August 30, 2019)</strong></em></p> <p>In <em>Part 2</em>, solvers are encouraged to leverage and build upon winning concepts to develop a working prototype for Government testing and evaluation. Solvers need not register in Challenge.gov to participate.

For example, what is the traditional or cultural practice? How does it contribute to health and wellness in AI/AN populations?</li> <li>A description of how this tradition or culture affects people&rsquo;s lives. The impact could be lives saved, suffering reduced, fewer visits to health care facilities, adopting a healthier lifestyle, and similar such benefits. How is this practice promoted within tribal populations?</li> <li>Information about the unmet health and wellness needs of AI/AN communities. What is the unmet need? Is there an understanding of what interventions or actions may help address these needs?</li> <li>A discussion of how biomedical or behavioral research can further Tribal health and wellness. What are the current gaps in Tribal health research and opportunities for improving health in AI/AN communities?&nbsp; What are some of the barriers or challenges in closing these gaps?&nbsp; How would addressing them reduce mortality, improve quality of life, or otherwise positively affect Tribal communities? &nbsp;The video must convey the research question of interest as part of a holistic picture of Tribal health or AI/AN communities.</li> </ul>\n<p>Contestants must include a link to a public or unlisted video on YouTube.com, Vimeo.com, or other internet accessible site.

The MPN is a voluntary, openly available resource designed to help health technology developers who collect digital health data clearly convey information about their privacy and security policies to their users. Similar to a nutrition facts label, the MPN provides a snapshot of a product&rsquo;s existing privacy practices, encouraging transparency and helping consumers make informed choices when selecting products. The MPN does not mandate specific policies or substitute for more comprehensive or detailed privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/privacysnapshotinfowebinar\">Watch the recording</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2jYWok1\">download the slides</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the informational and Q&amp;A webinar on Thursday, January 12</strong></p>\n<p>In 2011, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) collaborated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and released a Model Privacy Notice focused on personal health records (PHRs), which were the emerging technology at the time (<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn#2011phr\">view&nbsp;2011 PHR MPN</a>). The project&rsquo;s goals were to increase consumers&rsquo; awareness of companies&rsquo; PHR data practices and empower consumers by providing them with an easy way to compare the data practices of two or more PHR companies. In the last five years, the health information technology market has changed significantly and there is now a larger variety of products such as mobile applications and wearable devices that collect digital health data.</p>\n<p>ONC recognized a need to update the MPN to make it applicable to a broad range of consumer health technologies beyond PHRs. More and more individuals are obtaining access to their electronic health information and using consumer health technology to manage this information. As retail products that collect digital health data directly from consumers are used, such as exercise trackers, it is increasingly important for consumers to be aware of companies&rsquo; privacy and security policies and information sharing practices. Health technology developers can use the MPN to easily enter their information practices and produce a notice to allow consumers to quickly learn and understand privacy policies, compare company policies, and make informed decisions. Many consumer health technologies are offered by organizations that are not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security standards. This is detailed in the HHS report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/non-covered_entities_report_june_17_2016.pdf\">Examining Oversight of the Privacy &amp; Security of Health Data Collected by Entities Not Regulated by HIPAA</a>, released in July 2016 by ONC&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Privacy Officer with the cooperation of the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the FTC.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge&nbsp;leverages updated content developed recently by ONC, with feedback from OCR, FTC, and other private and public stakeholders. The content also underwent informal consumer testing. The Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge provides an award to the creators of the best MPN generator that produces a customizable MPN for health technology developers. The Challenge is a call for designers, developers, and health data privacy experts to create an online MPN generator that is easy for health technology developers to use in customizing a privacy notice that is compelling and understandable to consumers. Submissions will provide the code for an open source, web-based tool that allows health technology developers who collect digital health data to generate a customized privacy notice. The MPN generator must be able to produce privacy notices that adhere to the MPN content yet provide for customization by a health technology developer.&nbsp;Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf\">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf</a>&nbsp;to download the MPN.&nbsp;You can find more information about the development of the 2016 MPN&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn\">ONC's MPN page</a>.</p>\n<p>The code for the web-based generator must be posted to GitHub and be available through the open source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/\">MIT License 1.0</a>&nbsp;such that any app developer can implement and use it. The solution should be developed as an HTML webpage styled using CSS (or SASS)&nbsp;that is powered by a framework, library, or plugin developed in JavaScript that is packaged and made available as one of the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>JQuery Plugin</li> <li>Node.JS Module</li> <li>Standalone Script</li> </ul>\n<p>The final output of a successful submission is an MPN generator that can create customized privacy notices that would be accessible from an app or other consumer health technology; the privacy notices must, following the MPN, inform and educate the app or technology user so that they understand how the app or technology uses their personal health data. What the privacy notices created by the MPN generator look like and how they educate the user is up to the submitter &ndash; for example, the notices can be interactive or use graphics and images; however, it cannot be a simple static document such as a pdf. The MPN generator should create privacy notices that factor in accessibility, clean web design, and the differences between reading and understanding content on paper versus online, for which resources like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/\">Health Literacy Online</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/\">Draft U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/\">Usability.gov&nbsp;</a>can be helpful. Submitters are also required to undertake consumer testing of the final customizable MPN produced by the MPN generator, which is intended to help bring in direct user feedback. Testing can be formal (such as standardized assessments or focus groups) or informal (such as among family members or individuals in a waiting room).</p>\n<p>Submitters must provide evidence of testing with at least five people. A larger amount of time spent with each tester, greater formal rigor, and the number and diversity of people used for testing will result in a more positive assessment under the selection criteria. Evidence demonstrating consumer testing could include sample feedback, quotes, or pictures, and should include how it affected development of the language, design, and/or structure of the customizable MPN. Resources like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/\">https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/</a>&nbsp;can help.</p>\n",

Available water storage, over time, decreases as sediment deposition occurs, thus decreasing the capacity for storage. &nbsp;This sediment deposition, known as sedimentation, also adversely affects reservoir infrastructure operation and maintenance such as outlet works and water intakes. Assessing the loss of storage capacity currently is an expensive and time consuming process performed directly by in-field surveys.

Air quality managers and public health officials have limited access to accurate information on ground-level air pollution levels in the vicinity of wildland fires, making it difficult to provide appropriate strategies to minimize smoke exposure. Most air pollution monitoring equipment is large, not easily transportable, and complex to operate. Today, emerging technologies – including miniaturized direct-reading sensors, compact/powerful microprocessors, and wireless data communications – offer the opportunity to develop new systems to quickly gather and communicate air pollution data.\nWild fires are increasingly common events that produce significant air pollution, posing health risks to first responders, residents in nearby areas, and downwind communities. Also, wild fires are increasing in frequency and intensity, and the fire season is growing longer.  Prescribed fires, which are used to manage ecosystems or reduce risk of wild fires, are typically managed to minimize downwind impacts on populated areas; however, people in close proximity may still be exposed to smoke.  The description “wildland fires” refers to both wild and prescribed fires.\nThis challenge seeks a field-ready prototype system capable of measuring constituents of smoke, including particulates, carbon monoxide, ozone, and carbon dioxide, over the wide range of levels expected during wildland fires. The prototype system should be accurate, light-weight, easy to operate, and capable of wireless data transmission, so that first responders and nearby communities have access to timely information about local air quality conditions during wildland fire events.</p>\n",

In addition, the self-reported nature of responses particularly in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep has been a major limitation in these surveillance systems, since self-reported data are subject to under/over reporting and recall bias. Meanwhile, the advent of new technologies and data sources including wearable devices ( such as:&nbsp; smart watches, activity trackers, sleep monitors, etc.), mobile health applications on smartphones or tablets, and data from social media represents an opportunity to enhance the ability to monitor health-related information and potentially adjust for methodological limitations in traditional self-reported data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Healthy Behavior Data (HBD) Challenge will be conducted concurrently with a similar challenge proposed by the Public Health Agency of Canada.&nbsp; This will enable the two countries to learn from their respective challenges and leverage information.&nbsp; We expect increased efficiency with a dual challenge.</p>\n<p>The Healthy Behavior Data Challenge participants will propose data sources and approaches for aggregating data from wearable devices, mobile applications and/or social media in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep. In Phase II (Prototype Implementation), a subset of submissions (up to 3) with promising concepts will be invited to test their proposed approaches for ongoing public health surveillance.</p>\n",
            "prizes": "<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Catherine Bass</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Onlife Health - Closing the Loop</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Augmenting Mobile Data Sources for Public Health Surveillance The system was designed to simplify and improve the quality and quantity of health behavior data collection by aggregating personal wearable device and mobile health app data, augmented by user validation and supplemented with survey responses. The mobile app was designed to collect and validate data from wearable devices and mobile apps and to collect survey responses on healthy behaviors. The data collected include nutrition, sleep, physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The project included a series of short, just-in-time survey questions delivered via push notification to supplement mobile data sources. The system cross-validated the collected healthy behavior data from the mobile and survey data sets, as well as with the BRFSS survey data. Robert Furberg - RTI International - Enhancing Public Health Surveillance Indicators using Wearable Devices The method was designed to augment any mode of data collection, from interviewer-administered in-person or telephone surveys to self-administration online or via mobile device, with minimal disruption to these essential data collection activities. The project demonstrated how the combination of self-generated data can enhance public health surveillance indicators to provide valid, measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep. The approach implemented a three-step data collection:&nbsp; screening, survey, and data retrieval. Owners of Fitbit devices were invited to participate in the HBDC. A service called Fitabase was used for data retrieval of the three measures.</p>\n",

School meal applications have slowed to a trickle and your office is switching gears to draw your verification sample. You have high hopes that the plan you spent so much time refining over the summer will increase your household response rate:&nbsp; a re-designed verification selection notice, text message reminders, and that brilliant idea that Wanda came up with! Surely one of those will make a difference...  You would feel just a little more confident if you knew that another school district had success with a similar strategy.</em></p> <hr /> <p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>School districts approved almost five million household applications for free or reduced price school meal benefits last year. Nearly nine million children from low income families were named on those applications. You know how vital the school meal programs are to the families in your district. But you also recognize the importance of the annual verification process.</p> <p>Many school districts struggle with low verification response rates. Despite their best efforts some districts get barely half of their households to respond. For other districts a 50 percent response rate would be a big improvement.</p> <p>But just as many districts have identified low-cost and creative strategies, often through trial and error, that allow them to consistently exceed 70, 80, or 90 percent response rates. In some cases those strategies are tailored to unique local circumstances and may not be practical anywhere else. But other strategies are more universal – sometimes a great idea is just a great idea.</p>    <hr /> <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p> <p>The “Verification Response Rate Challenge” is a public forum for school district officials to exchange ideas on how to increase household response in the annual verification process. District staff can share their own verification success stories or they can build on others’ submissions with constructive feedback and suggestions. Either way, the goal is to encourage dialog, refine ideas, and put great strategies to work.</p> <p>Your contribution may help other school districts increase their verification response rates, reduce the time and expense associated with repeat follow-up reminders to households, and reduce the risk that eligible children lose access to program benefits.</p> <p>The challenge is structured as a contest to maximize engagement and help uncover the most effective solutions. A panel of distinguished judges will review participant submissions on criteria that include proven success, cost effectiveness, practicality, and creativity. USDA will feature submissions recognized in several categories at this summer’s School Nutrition Association Annual National Conference in Atlanta. </p> </div>\n",

            "description": "<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n\n<p>Manufacturing is important for America’s prosperity. It is estimated that for every dollar spent in U.S. manufacturing, another $1.89 is added to the economy; the highest multiplier effect of any economic sector. Manufacturing accounts for millions of jobs and about 12% of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product. With all that economic activity, the industrial sector accounted for about one-third of total U.S. energy consumption in 20173. Making smart energy investments will enhance our nation’s security, productivity, and energy independence. For manufacturers, every dollar saved allows for investment in production, facilities, and jobs that ultimately makes U.S. companies more competitive and resilient. Improving the energy performance of manufacturing facilities has a broad impact; savings from reduced operating expenses can be reinvested in technology upgrades and new jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Finding ways to cut costs through energy savings seems like an obvious strategy; however, many times these opportunities go unrealized due to competing demands for capital, plant personnel, lack of information, or lack of attention/prioritization. Nevertheless, all across America, manufacturers are showing real leadership, stepping up as champions of energy savings and sustainability. The success of these efforts do not happen without strong leadership from individuals working in the manufacturing facilities, who step up to recognize and implement energy saving opportunities, and who find innovative approaches to push through barriers they encounter along the way.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Individuals Taking Energy Action in Manufacturing (ITEAM) Prize competition seeks to identify and attract attention to a wide range of ideas and practices that are driving measureable energy savings at U.S. manufacturing plants to stimulate innovation at other facilities. To do so, DOE is launching the ITEAM Prize competition as a means to:</p>\n\n<p>(1) Find individuals who were responsible for creative, specific, and innovative ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at their manufacturing facilities; and</p>\n\n<p>(2) Encourage those individuals to widely share their ideas and practices for the benefit of U.S. Manufacturing facilities nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>Through the ITEAM Prize competition, DOE is seeking the ideas and best practices from employees on the plant floor all around the country who not only recognize the importance of saving energy but are making it happen, strengthening their company’s competitiveness and driving cost savings in the process. By sharing successful strategies and examples of leadership, more manufacturers can drive energy productivity improvements and accelerate the adoption of energy efficient technologies.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"qa\">Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n<p><strong>1. The application deadline is 6 months from now. Is there any advantage to submitting an application now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Can I nominate the leader of our team, that was just recognized for a Better Project Award?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Recognition for a Better Project Award does not impact eligibility under the ITEAM Prize competition. DOE does not make eligibility determinations prior to receiving a complete submission. Participants should view the prize rules and assess whether their submission meets the eligibility requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals may submit an entry on their own behalf. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Can we submit multiple applications (i.e. individuals from multiple facilities)?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Can the cash prize be given to our company foundation instead of the individual?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Individuals may submit an entry on their own behalf. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility.</p>\n\n<p>Applicants will have the option to decline the cash prize if selected and still be recognized as a winner and participate in the events and activities described above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. This information states that plant floor people, but the qualifications do not get very specific. What about staff engineering people? An example would be a lighting engineer who leads and guides all facilities discussion related to lighting efficiency improvements at all plants.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The competition is open to individual employees taking energy action at the manufacturing facility where they are employed. The rules do not restrict the job positions/titles of the participants. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility.

This challenge is unique because the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to fund the “would be” startup Founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g. small business grants).</p> <p>NIDA, one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the “2017:&nbsp; $100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the basis for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA hopes that participation in the contest will enable scientists to test the hypothesis that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually any newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and provide mentorship support from NIDA entrepreneurship experts. </strong>The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p> <p><strong>CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION</strong> </p> <p>NIDA is excited to build upon the success of the 2016 Challenge “<a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/100000-for-start-a-sud-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup</a>” and is reissuing it in 2017. The challenge is a competition for biomedical scientists with the goal to support research ideas that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that are intended to be the basis for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA hopes that participation in the contest will enable scientists to test whether their research ideas can be fostered into a biotech startup. The 2017 \"$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and provide mentorship support from NIDA entrepreneurship experts.</p> <p>What does it take to participate in the challenge? The team or an individual must have a research idea that could further the understanding of SUD and is intended to be the basis of the development of a new and potentially successful startup. The research “idea” is the product that your future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products, aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to an underserved customer. The Founder (the teams or an individual) must demonstrate through the Submission the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty.</p> <p>The winners of this challenge are encouraged to use the prize funds to develop a minimum viable proof (MVP) as quickly as possible and to obtain customer feedback to discover if MVP meets the customer needs. If the product prototype is successfully validated, winners are encouraged to create or further advance their biotech startup no later than 6 months after the prize is awarded. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.</p> <p>The research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications consistent with SUD or be specific for prevention and treatments of SUD. For example, if your idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to progress faster and with greater fidelity, entering this challenge is appropriate.</p> <p>The judging of the Challenge is now completed. Based upon the Challenge criteria, the judging panel has selected 10 submissions for the Challenge awards:</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> University of California, Los Angeles (Keith Heinzerling, Dustin DeYoung, Marisa Briones)<br /><strong>Submission Title:</strong> Medication Development for Substance Use Disorders</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> OPAT (Alex Rich, John Cronin, Jarrod Parker, Cameron Yick)<br />    <strong>Submission Title:</strong> Opioid Prescribing Awareness Tool</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> Cornell Engineering World Health (group of multidisciplinary students leading by Nadine Farhat, Michael Solomentsev, Joanna Davis, Ben Edwards, and Jacob Mathai)<br />    <strong>Submission Title:</strong> Drug Usage App - Sensory Monitoring</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> Pillsy Inc.

The ultimate goal is to achieve science-based stewardship of local water resources. This project proposes that two sensors be deployed, one each at the top and bottom of the Lower Galena River subwatershed to gather continuous data on nitrate levels in this portion of the Galena River. The League has been building relationships throughout the area for over six years and those relationships will provide valuable avenues for communicating the results of the data obtained through continuous nitrate monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;These data will be used as a basis for shifting landowners to best management practices designed to reduce nutrient pollution.&nbsp;</p> </div>\n<p><strong>Development of a Real-time, Continuous Nutrient Monitoring Network for Western Lake Erie to Address Management of HABs and Hypoxia&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Team Lead:&nbsp; Thomas Johengen, Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), University of Michigan&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has been experiencing increased water quality impairment, primarily in the form of extensive toxic cyanobacterial blooms.&nbsp; To combat the growing impacts on the ecosystem health and services of these tremendous natural resources, the Governments of Canada and the United States developed revised binational phosphorus reduction targets for Lake Erie with a goal of 40% lower loading rates then established under the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA).&nbsp;To determine progress toward meeting nutrient reduction targets and verifying the response in the lake, active surveillance of nutrients in the lake is essential. Phosphorus concentrations in Lake Erie are highly variable in time and space, making it difficult to determine long-term trends. Deployment of continuous monitoring sensors to provide nearly continuous data will be a critical component of successful nutrient management.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>High Frequency Nitrogen Sensors in Portland, Maine</strong> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Team Lead:&nbsp; Curtis C. Bohlen, Casco Bay Estuary Partnership&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Casco Bay borders Portland and South Portland, Maine's principal economic and technological hub.&nbsp;This project&nbsp;proposes the use high frequency nitrate plus nitrite data collected near Portland's East End to provide data applicable to evaluating the impact of the East End discharges on Casco Bay, clarify the relative importance of riverine inputs, wastewater discharges, stormwater, and combined sewer overflows as sources of nutrients to the waters around Portland, support Maine DEP's RP analyses, provide information on the range of nutrient concentrations experienced by eelgrass beds,&nbsp;and provide data to support development of a better model&nbsp;of nutrient processes in Casco Bay.</div></p>\n<p><strong>Monitoring the Effects of Storms and Conowingo Dam Inputs on Nutrients in the Upper Chesapeake Bay</strong></p>\n<p>Lora Harris (Team Lead) &amp; Jeremy Testa, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mike Trice, Maryland Department of Natural Resources</p>\n<p>The Chesapeake Bay estuary has a long history of degraded water quality&nbsp;associated with elevated inputs of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sediments from its large watershed that spans six states and the District of Columbia. The Conowingo Dam, which is located in the lower Susquehanna River - the Bay's largest source of nutrients and freshwater - is decreasingly effective at holding back silt from entering the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, additional nutrients associated with those silts are entering Chesapeake Bay and nutrient and sediment reduction strategies are being developed to address the increased nutrient load. The impact of these \"new\" nutrient inputs to Chesapeake Bay, however, remains poorly understood. This project would place two sensors in the Upper Chesapeake Bay and provide much data on how the nutrient load changes over time and in response to storm events. This can help validate models and give insight into the effect these nutrients will have on phytoplankton production and associated oxygen depletion in the estuary.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantifying the impact of dam removals on nitrate retention using low cost nitrate sensors</strong></p>\n<p>Team Lead:&nbsp; Dr.Wilfred Wollheim, Department of Natural Resources and Environment, University of New Hampshire</p>\n<p>Current understanding of how reservoirs affect nitrogen moving through river systems is based on a small number of studies in larger reservoirs. These studies also looked at annual estimates rather than evaluating how nutrient retention varied through&nbsp;time. Dams and their reservoirs are increasingly being removed from the landscape, often because they are aging and would need costly repairs, have no significant utility and/or to improve anadromous fish passage and connectivity with spawning areas. Because reservoirs created by dams are potentially effective at removing nitrogen, such dam removals come with tradeoffs, including reduced nitrate removal. We propose to deploy sensors upstream and downstream of several reservoirs in coastal New England to quantify nitrate removal across seasons and storm events. We will&nbsp;also take advantage of ongoing dam removals and management activities to quantify the nitrogen removal by reservoirs.</p>\n",

USDA NIFA will partner with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) to provide entrepreneurship training to USDA NIFA grantees under this I-FAST pilot program. The goals are to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from NIFA supported academic research. Selected USDA NIFA I-FAST project teams will have the opportunity to concurrently participate in the educational programs with NSF I-Corps awardees. Over a period of six months the USDA NIFA supported teams in the I-FAST program will learn what it will take to achieve an economic impact with their particular innovation. The final goal of the I-FAST Competition is to facilitate technology transfer of innovations that can make an impact in the marketplace and the global economy.</p> <p><strong>Subject of the Challenge Competition:</strong></p> <p>The USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) mission is to invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges.</p> <p>As part of this mission NIFA is charged with providing grant funding for research, education, and extension that address key problems of national, regional, and multi-state importance in sustaining all components of agriculture. A majority of NIFA grant funding is provided to academic institutions to focus on developing research in the areas of farm efficiency and profitability, ranching, renewable energy, forestry (both urban and agroforestry), aquaculture, rural communities and entrepreneurship, human nutrition, food safety, biotechnology, and conventional breeding.</p> <p>USDA NIFA will partner with the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) who will provide an Entrepreneurial Immersion course and training to USDA NIFA grantees through this I-FAST Competition. The goals of this Competition are to spur translation of fundamental research to the market place, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NIFA-funded faculty, students and other researchers to understand innovation and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>The purpose of the I-FAST Competition is to identify NIFA-funded research teams who will receive additional support, in the form of mentoring, training, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that can attract subsequent third-party funding. NIFA-funded research teams will be required to participate in Entrepreneurial Immersion courses provided by the NSF I-Corps program. Each team that receives an I-FAST award is required to participate in the following NSF I-CORP activities:</p> <ol> <li>Attendance by the entire team at an on-site three-day NSF I-CORP Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li> <li>Mandatory participation in the I-CORPs weekly Webinars following the in-person three day on-site meeting;</li> <li>Completion of approximately 15 hours of preparation per week over the duration of the program;</li> <li>Attendance of a two-day lessons-learned in-person meeting at the end of the training. During the training, teams are expected to engage in at least 100 contacts with potential customers and provide a 5-page summary report back to USDA NIFA on the outcome of the training and milestones to be met by the team (i.e., commercialization, market proposition, and lessons learned from the program).</li> </ol> <p>The major focus of I-FAST is for the selected teams (an I-FAST team includes the Principal Investigator (PI), the Entrepreneurial Lead, and the Mentor) to participate in an Entrepreneurial Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program. The NSF I-Corps is a program specifically designed to broaden the impact of select, basic research projects by preparing scientists and engineers to focus beyond the laboratory. Leveraging experience and guidance from established entrepreneurs and a targeted curriculum within the NSF I-Corp program, USDA I-FAST teams will learn to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from USDA NIFA supported academic research. The I-FAST Competition will help create a stronger national ecosystem for innovation that couples scientific discovery with technology development to address agricultural and societal needs. </p> <p><strong>DATES:</strong> </p> <p>Competition Submission Period – Pre-Application Phase:&nbsp; August 3, 2017 to September 8, 2017</p> <p>Evaluation and Judging - Pre-Application Evaluation and Interviews:&nbsp;  September 11, 2017 to September 14, 2017</p> <p>Competition Submission Period – Full Application September 15, 2017 to October 6, 2017 - <strong>(Only Selected Pre-Applicants are Eligible)</strong></p> <p>Evaluation and Judging – Final Evaluation and Judging – Full Application:&nbsp; October 9, 2017 to October 11, 2017</p> <p>Verification of Winners:&nbsp; October 13, 2017</p> <p>Announcement of Winner(s):&nbsp; October 17, 2017</p> <p>NSF I-Corps Training for Winner(s):&nbsp; Winning team(s) will need to be available to travel to and attend one of the following NSF I-Corps training sessions with the following dates and locations:</p> <p><strong>Winter 2018 COHORTS:</strong></p> <p>Winter Cohort \\#1:&nbsp; Seattle, WA</p> <ul> <li>Kickoff (on-site):&nbsp; January (arrive 16) 17-19, 2018</li> <li>Web sessions (online):&nbsp; Thursdays 1-4pm ET –  January 24, 31 February 7, 14, 21, 2018</li> <li>Lessons Learned (on-site):&nbsp; March 1-2, 2018</li> </ul> <p>Winter Cohort \\#2:&nbsp; Atlanta, GA</p> <ul> <li>Kickoff (on-site):&nbsp; January (arrive 21) 22-24, 2018</li> <li>Web sessions (online):&nbsp; Mondays 1-4pm ET – January 29, February 5, 12, 19, 26, 2018</li> <li>Lessons Learned (on-site):&nbsp; March 5-6, 2018</li> </ul> <p>The Pre-Application Phase Competition Submission Period begins August 3, 2017 at 10:00 a.m. ET and ends September 8, 2017 at 12:00 a.m. ET.

The prior award could range from a modest single-investigator award to a large, distributed center and also includes awards involving students.</p> <p>To be eligible to win a prize under the Competition, Teams:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Shall have registered to participate in the Competition under the rules;</li>    <li>Shall have complied with all the requirements of the Competition rules;</li> <li>May not include a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment; and</li> <li>In the case of a private entity Team member, the member shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States. In the case of an individual Team member, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.</li> </ul> <p>Makeup of I-FAST Competition Teams:&nbsp; Each Team shall consist of three members:</p> <ul> <li>Entrepreneurial Lead (EL)</li> <li>I-FAST Team Mentor</li> <li>Principal Investigator (PI)</li> </ul> <p>I-FAST teams are made up of individuals from an academic/university institution except for the Mentor who may reside with an outside organization as described below.</p> <p>The Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) could be a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, or other student with relevant knowledge of the technology located at the academic/university institution and a deep commitment to investigate the commercial landscape surrounding the innovation. The EL should also be capable and have the will to support the transition of the technology, should the I-FAST Team’s project demonstrate the potential for commercial viability. The EL will be responsible for:&nbsp; 1) developing the team to include the mentor and PI, 2) leading the development of the pre-application, participating in the I-FAST interviews and developing the full application, if selected, 3) starting and completing all training activities in the Entrepreneurial Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program, 4) communicating and coordinating with team members to achieve the goals of the team, 5) developing and monitoring team activity milestones from the Entrepreneurial Immersion course, 6) ensuring the team milestones are completed on time, and 7) ensuring the team is in communication with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director as needed.</p> <p>The I-FAST Teams Mentor will typically be an experienced or emerging entrepreneur with proximity to the academic/university institution and have experience in transitioning technology out of the academic arena. The Mentor should be selected as a third-party resource, or may be a person that has an established relationship with the team (e.g., Board Member), but cannot be an employee nor directly involved with the technology development. Ideally, the Industry Expert should have prior experience developing and commercializing other products within the broader technology space related to the specific project under development. The EL will need to identify a Mentor that has business expertise in the proposed technology sector and has entrepreneurial experience. A Mentor will be someone with the right “rolodex” of contacts in the technology area of commercialization which are critical for “getting the technology out of the university.” The EL of the team should contact their University Technology Transfer Office for ideas of potential Mentors. The I-FAST Team’s Mentor will be responsible for guiding the team forward using existing entrepreneurial experience and tracking the team’s progress through regular communication with the EL, PI, the NIFA I-FAST competition director, and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, as needed.</p> <p>The PI will have in-depth knowledge of the innovation developed under the earlier USDA NIFA Grant and will be responsible for:&nbsp; 1) coordinating with the university on the transfer of prize funds from NIFA, if the team is selected, 2) tracking of the prize funding for team activities, 3) reporting to NIFA on disbursements and obligations of the prize funding, 4) guiding the EL and Mentor on technical aspects of the innovation, 5) communicating as needed with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, 6) ensuring the EL meets the required milestones for the NSF I-CORP training, and 7) participating as a team member.  The Principal Investigator who received the earlier NIFA grant for the technology is allowed to participate on the team, but cannot be the Entrepreneurial Lead.</p> <p>During the I-Corps course, each participating team, including all its team members, will be required to:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Attend, in person, an evening reception and 3-day kick-off Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li> <li>Conduct approximately 100 customer interviews over the 6-week program, and submit interview summary reports. This process of customer discovery “outside the building” is expected to require a minimum of 15 hours per week for at least five weeks;</li> <li>Participate in 5 weekly webinar sessions and submit regular updates to the team’s business model canvas. In addition, it is expected that I-Corps teams will take advantage of instructor office hours; and</li> <li>Attend, in person, the final 2-day course close out/lessons learned session (to be held in the same region as the kick-off course).</li> </ul> <p>If one or more team members cannot meet these requirements, the team should not pursue the program.</p> </div>\n",

In particular, better visualization approaches are needed to improve understanding and communication of current and projected conditions in the basin and the water management actions that affect those conditions. Reclamation and its Collaborators seek innovative, interactive, and user-driven visualizations to improve understanding of past, present, and projected conditions in the CRB and to support analysis and decision making by Reclamation and non-Reclamation users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/docs/DataVis_preview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dowload Full Preview</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/docs/dataviz_poster.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download Poster</a></p>\n<p><em>Questions about this Challenge?

            "description": "<p>[UPDATED 1/8/2018] We are pleased to announce the winning entries to the GSA Student Design Competition for the New San Francisco Federal Building Plaza. The competition challenged students to activate the existing plaza through program and design interventions. The jury evaluated 63 entries which met the submission guidelines and deadline requirements. Entries were evaluated against the judging criteria that were published in the competition announcement, which were Creativity, Context, Community, Feasibility, and Value. The more successful entries, including the winning entries, proposed a new program and offered creative new ways of using the plaza in order to activate the public space. While the competition awards three prizes, the jury felt that in light of the high number of excellent submissions, that they would like to recognize a fourth entry with a special honorable mention.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Honorable Mention &ndash; \"San Francisco Federal Plaza Urban Garden,\" Nancy Spaulding</span></strong> The proposal involves an extensive landscape design renovation that features a substantial addition of trees and other plantings suited to the climate. The design features an educational \"teaching garden,\" which might educate children from the childcare center within the building, as well as the general public. The featured planting would produce food for birds, insect pollinators, and humans. The improvements have the potential to attract visitors, including disadvantaged users, to the plaza. The proposal appeals to building occupants and addresses important community issues. Members of the jury imagine that the produce grown in the plaza could be served in the caf&eacute; in farm-to-table style. The proposal infuses the plaza with elements from the natural environment. The design addresses the needs of the site but does not inhibit future uses. The proposed forest engages visually with people in the upper floors of the federal building and adjacent buildings. The jury commends the urban garden proposal for its optimism.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Third Prize &ndash; \"Allegro,\" by Dan Kaiser</span></strong> This entry proposes an intervention that blurs the distinction between art and landscape. The formally aggressive intervention is inspired by sound waves and the existing building's form, combined to create seating and play space that is intended to transform the space at night. The inclusion of relevant case studies was useful to understand the design intent and feasibility of this proposal. The design refines the caf&eacute; building to maintain the original urban design intent of having a strong, well-defined corner, while also addressing the proposed new plaza design. The jury commends the creativity and quality of this visually stimulating proposal, which creates the potential for success whether people occupy the space as intended by the proposal or not.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Second Prize &ndash; \"Terraform,\" by Thomas Backman</span></strong> The entry proposes an ambitious renovation that is unique among the field of entries in that it proposed an entirely new programmatic use for the plaza. The proposed terrace enables occupants and the public to use this new semi-private space in new dramatic ways. The proposal entertains an expanded view of what is possible with the caf&eacute; and suggests the potential that the site may have for more retail and additional dining options to attract people and activate the plaza. The design establishes the plaza as a part of the city of San Francisco, borrowing symbols from the landscape of the city while preserving the national significance of the federal building. The entry acknowledges the layered contexts of the cultural landscape of the city and the rest of the country. The jury commends the proposal for the well-integrated consideration of programming, landscape, and architectural design.</p>\n<p><strong><span>First Prize &ndash; \"Keeping Time,\" by Margaret C. Weighner</span></strong> The entry is rooted in a conceptually strong and engaging proposal with significant potential to activate the plaza, however it is implemented with an even handed approach that is both respectful and complimentary of the existing building design, artwork, and surrounding context. The proposal challenges conventional notions of landscape architecture and urban design with a highly creative and contemporary intervention, communicated through a professional-quality presentation. A \"floating orb,\" traverses the site and beyond in motion reflective of the celestial movement of the moon, reminding visitors of the connection between the site, city, nation, and even the cosmos. The entry succeeds in explaining the general feasibility of the proposal through detailing an aluminum orb structure that would move along suspension cables while being illuminated by a heliostat. Visible at certain times from the busy pedestrian thoroughfares of nearby Market Street and United Nations Plaza, the orb extends the visibility of the plaza beyond the property line, engaging with both building occupants and the public. The entry inspired jury members to observe that the plaza could be further programmed as an art exhibition space for a series of similar conceptual art installations or performances that would be temporary or impermanent, citing MoMA PS1 in New York as a case study. Jurors used the words \"thoughtful,\" \"big-picture,\" and \"conceptually bold,\" to describe this entry, and award it with the first prize in the competition.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Join us for this exciting UAS (unmanned aerial systems) prize competition using your ingenuity and hardware build expertise to create a concept for a UAS prototype. The result of the <strong>UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) Flight and Payload Challenge&nbsp;</strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>\n<p>One of the barriers for UAS used in a public safety realm is payload versus flight time. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep the UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders&rsquo; communication technology on the ground while they conduct their search. The advancement of UAS research will help search and rescue operations support payloads for wireless communications or other life-saving goods to save lives.</p>\n<p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards totaling $432,000 (includes travel, prototype &amp; cash prizes) for the top 10 designs.&nbsp; In addition to the cash prize, finalists will showcase their UAS and flight skills with paid travel to the NIST Robotics Lab and the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference, where pilots will demonstrate their prototype, engage in speaking opportunities and network with 500+ attendees. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition.

            "description": "<p>The Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition, ARIAC, addresses a critical limitation of robots used in industrial environments like factory floors:&nbsp; they are not as agile as they need to be. Many robots are not able to quickly detect failures, or recover from those failures. They aren't able to sense changes in their environment and modify their actions accordingly. Programming these robots for even the simplest tasks takes time and effort. Help solve this problem by coding your own robot control system (software) that can outperform everyone else's in a simulated environment! Compete to win $17,500 in cash prizes and the opportunity to showcase your solution at a future robotics conference.

            "rules": "<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>Rules of the ARIAC Prize Competition</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Subject of the Competition:</strong></p>\n<p>In June 2017, the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) put on the first Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC). The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers. For the second year of the competition, we are introducing a cash prize to motivate and expand participation. In this context, agility is defined broadly to address:</p>\n<ul> <li>Failure identification and recovery, where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically recover from those failures</li> <li>Automated planning, to minimize (or eliminate) the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li> <li>Fixtureless environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts that are not in predefined locations</li> </ul>\n<p>The competition Participants are required to develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot in a simulated environment. Gazebo (gazebosim.com), which is an open source robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing platform and the Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software libraries and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.</p>\n<p>Software interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants to control the robot.&nbsp; There will be two qualifiers in the April 2018 timeframe with the final competition occurring in mid-May 2018. The competition will be performed virtually in the cloud, so physical attendance is not required to compete. NIST is proposing a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow the winning Participants to present their approaches; details, when available, will be posted to the official challenge website.</p>\n<p><strong>Dates of the Competition:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Qualifiers Begin:&nbsp; March 5, 2018</li> <li>Qualifiers End:&nbsp; April 13, 2018</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Begins:&nbsp; May 11, 2018</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Ends:&nbsp; 5:00 PM, EDT (UTC-10:00), May 17, 2018</li> <li>Announcement of Cash Prize Winners:&nbsp; May 18, 2018</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Event Website:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The Official Rules are posted at <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ARIAC/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ARIAC/</a>.</p>\n<p>The Event Website is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/ariac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Prize Amounts:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;place - $10,000</li> <li>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;place - $5,000</li> <li>3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;place - $2,500</li> </ul>\n<p>Up to three winners will be selected. The Prize Purse for the ARIAC Prize Competition is a total of $17,500. In addition, each winner may be able to select any one representative from their team to present their results at a robotics conference in 2018 in a workshop dedicated to the ARIAC competition. NIST may be able to provide travel funds subject to availability.&nbsp; The number of winners will be fewer than three if there are fewer than three Participants that qualify for the competition. The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website. NIST reserves the right to announce additional winners of non-cash prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules for being eligible to participate in the Competition:</strong></p>\n<p>Participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win cash prizes as explained in the next section.</p>\n<p>Each Competition Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website. There shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. The Official Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as a team or affiliation name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations per Participant are NOT allowed. At NIST's discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry (Participant&rsquo;s code submission to a qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Participants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible to participate.</p>\n<p>Once registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces needed to participate in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will create an account to allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the qualifiers. Modifications and improvements to a Participant's control system during the qualifying period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final control system ready for the final competition.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules for being eligible to win a Cash Prize:</strong></p>\n<p>To be eligible for a cash prize:</p>\n<ul> <li>A Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li> <li>At the time of Entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States or its territories.</li> <li>In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.</li> <li>Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment. NIST employees are not eligible to participate. Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.</li> <li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li> </ul>\n<p>In addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Participate in the Competition:</strong></p>\n<p>An interested Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering at the ARIAC website. The party is then given access to view the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants will be notified by email.</p>\n<p>Once registered, the Participants are eligible to participate in the qualifiers. There will be two qualifiers, both occurring in the April 2018 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants only have to complete one of the two qualifiers to be eligible to compete in the final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifiers to be eligible for the final competition.</p>\n<p>During ARIAC Qualifiers/Finals, each team will submit their system so that it can be run in the automated evaluation setup. This is to ensure that teams are not using prohibited interfaces to interact with the simulation.&nbsp;They will have two work weeks from the date that each qualifier is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants will be emailed when the qualifier is released. The&nbsp;following files should be uploaded to an account (<a href=\"http://nfiles.nist.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nfiles.nist.gov</a>) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant. To allow the ARIAC Competition controllers to automatically run each team's system, teams are required to submit the following files:</p>\n<ul> <li><em>team_config.yaml</em>:&nbsp; The team's sensor configuration file. One sensor configuration is used for all trials.</li> <li><em>build_team_system.bash</em>:&nbsp; A bash script that, when invoked from the command-line on a clean Ubuntu system, will install the necessary dependencies and build the team's code.</li> <li><em>run_team_system.bash</em>:&nbsp; A bash script that, when invoked from the command-line on a system that has had <em>build_team_system.bash&nbsp;</em>run, will start the team's system and begin interacting with the ARIAC competition trial.</li> </ul>\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>build_team_system.bash</em>&nbsp;script will be run only once to setup the team's system, and the&nbsp;<em>run_team_system.bash</em>&nbsp;script will be run one time for each of the scenarios to be tested against.</p>\n<p><strong>Competition Scenarios</strong></p>\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document</p>\n<ul> <li>Order:&nbsp; A list of products and their goal location in a box.</li> <li>Product:&nbsp; One element of an order.</li> <li>Box:&nbsp; A container that holds the products.</li> <li>Fulfilled Order:&nbsp; A box and set of products that make up an order.</li> </ul>\n<p>ARIAC requires Participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that is based around order fulfillment. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the Work Environment section. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul> <li>Baseline Order Fulfillment - The task for this scenario is to pick specific products and place them in a box. The robot arm will receive an <em>Order</em> that details the list of products and their target locations.</li> <li>Dropped Product - One or more products will drop from the robot's gripper. The robot will need to recover after dropping a product and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped product, or fetching a new product.</li> <li>In-Process Order Change<strong> - </strong>While the robot is in the middle of fulfilling an order, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robot will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</li> </ul>\n<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials:&nbsp; Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\n<p><em><u>Environment</u></em></p>\n<p>The simulation environment is a representation of an industrial order fulfillment work cell with a robot arm, product bins, and boxes.</p>\n<p>There are multiple product bins that may be used for order fulfillment. Products in these bins will not be replaced once used. There is a robot arm mounted on a linear actuator. The linear actuator measures <strong>4 m</strong>.</p>\n<p>An automated guided vehicle (AGV) and/or drone is located at the end of the linear actuator. Orders are fulfilled at the AGV/drone. A Participant will programmatically signal the AGV/drone when the fulfilled orders are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV/drone will depart with the box.</p>\n<p>Boxes measuring <strong>0.5 x 0.7 m</strong>. are used for order fulfillment.</p>\n<p><em><u>Robot Arm</u></em></p>\n<p>The robot arm's position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted. The end of the arm is equipped with a vacuum gripper.</p>\n<p>The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</p>\n<p><em><u>Sensors</u></em></p>\n<p>A Participant can choose which sensors to use around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score.</p>\n<p>A sample of available sensors may include:</p>\n<ol> <li>Break beam:&nbsp; reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li> <li>Laser scanner:&nbsp; provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li> <li>Cognex logical camera:&nbsp; provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li> <li>Proximity:&nbsp; detects the range to an object.</li> </ol>\n<p><em><u>Order</u></em></p>\n<p>An order is an instruction containing products for the robot system to place in the box. Each order will specify the products to be gathered.</p>\n<p><em><u>Faulty products</u></em></p>\n<p>Above the belt at a key location is a quality control sensor that detects faulty products. If faulty products are detected while Participants are filling boxes, those products should be removed from the box and replaced with another product of the same type.</p>\n<p>Faulty products are considered unwanted products:&nbsp; they will not count for any points when the order is fulfilled, and they will cost Participants the all-products bonus if left in the boxes (see Scoring, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Competition Process</strong></p>\n<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\n<ol> <li>The robot programmatically signals that it is able to begin accepting orders.</li> <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robot.</li> <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li> <li>In the case of the Dropped Product testing method, up to three products will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li> <li>In the case of the In-Process Order Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li> <li>The robot signals programmatically when an order is ready for delivery.</li> <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li> </ol>\n<p><strong>Judging Panel </strong></p>\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>\n<p><strong>Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</strong></p>\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant's final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost Metrics</strong> The following values are calculated for a Participant&rsquo;s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials. The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The costs are:</p>\n<ol> <li style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> <ol> <li>$500 for each logical camera used.</li> <li>$200 for each depth camera used.</li> <li>$100 for each other sensor used (e.g., break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li> </ol> </li> </ol>\n<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be divided by a baseline cost of $1700 and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as <em>TC</em>, and the baseline cost is designated as B<em>C</em>.&nbsp; The cost factor, is then calculated as:</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/cost-metrics.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Completion Score</strong></p>\n<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the shipping box. The completion score, <em>CS</em>, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the shipping box. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the shipping box and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order s_<em>j</em>&nbsp;with <em>i</em> products in it would have a maximum score of:</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/completion-score.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency Factor</strong></p>\n<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first order is completed and is designated as <em>T_01</em>. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, <em>Tj</em> is counted in seconds from the time that the <em>j</em>th order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times for each team (<em>ATj</em>) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/efficiency-factor.png\" /></p>\n<p>If a team&rsquo;s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.</p>\n<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, <em>h</em>, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final <em>h</em> value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>\n<p><strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/trial-score-calculation.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Final Score Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>The final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Order Fulfillment, Dropped Products, and In-Process Order Change scenarios, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Winners:</strong>&nbsp;The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\n<p><em>Judging Criteria:</em></p>\n<ol> <li><strong>Overall Performance based on the scoring metrics described above (80 points)</strong> <ol> <li>Using the scoring metrics described herein, the first place Entry will be award 80 points, the second place Entry will be award 70 points, the third place Entry will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Novelty of approach and alignment with spirit of competition (20 points)</strong> <ol> <li>At the judges&rsquo; sole discretion, up to 20 points will be awarded for Entries that show novel approaches to solving the agility challenges and whose approaches are consistent with the spirit of the competition of coming up with industrially-implementable approaches that will help industry make better use of their robotic platforms.

The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST's sole discretion. Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>\n<p>The winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as \"undeliverable\" will result in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seven (7) calendar days of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified in the winning Entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative. The list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website. Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition. All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants.</p>\n<p><strong>Presentation of Winning Approaches at a To Be Determined Workshop in a Robotics Conference:</strong></p>\n<p>Up to three Winners of the ARIAC Competition may be invited by NIST to attend a workshop dedicated to the ARIAC Competition at a future TBD robotics conference.

            "description": "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the launch of the Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge.</p>\n<p>Million Hearts&reg;&nbsp;is a national initiative to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes by 2022. Achieving this goal means 10 million more Americans must have their blood pressure under control. Million Hearts&reg; is working to control high blood pressure through clinical approaches, such as using health information technology to its fullest potential and integrating team-based approaches to health care, and community approaches, such as strengthening tobacco control and promoting physical activity.</p>\n<p>To support improved blood pressure control, HHS/CDC is announcing the 2018 Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge. This competition identifies practices, clinicians, and health systems that have worked with their patients to achieve hypertension control rates at or above 80% through innovations in health information technology and electronic health records, patient communication, and health care team approaches. The application will be scored based on the hypertension control rate for your most recent 12-month reporting period ending not earlier than December 31, 2017; and the degree to which the patient populations' characteristics present significant challenges in attaining hypertension control (up to 5% score). Applicants with the highest score will be required to participate in a two-phase process to verify their data. Applicants who are non-compliant or non-responsive with the data requests or timelines will be removed from further consideration.</p>\n<p>Phase 1 includes verification of the hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data submitted and a background check. For applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, phase 2 consists of a medical chart review. In addition, background checks will be conducted by an independent source for individual or small practice applicants to ensure there are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred (as outlined in the Eligibility section). For large providers or health systems, their background check policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance with the individual background check protocol. In addition, a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission's sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., investigations for professional medical misconduct).</p>\n<p>Phase 2 of the validation, for applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, consists of hypertension control validation via medical chart review. Applicants must provide documents showing the criteria used to include patients as \"controlled\" and a list with each hypertensive patient found to have blood pressure in control. Thirty patient records will be selected randomly for file review for compliance. For the thirty records selected, electronic copies of all of the pertinent medical records will be submitted through a secure FTP site with a secure login.</p>\n",

            "how-to-enter": "<p>To enter the Challenge, participants must complete the application form online. The application form is a combination of short answer responses, checkbox responses, and assurances. Application information includes:</p>\n<ol> <li>The size of the applicant's adult patient population defined as the number of adult patients served during the reporting year regardless of diagnosis, a summary of known patient demographics (e.g., age distribution), and any noteworthy patient population characteristics. The reporting year (12-months) should reflect the most currently available data with an end date no earlier than December 31, 2017.</li> <li>The percent of the applicant's adult patient population identified above that were seen during the reporting year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence). There are an estimated 11 million people who are unaware of their hypertension. Most of these people are hiding in plain sight&mdash;they are in clinical treatment with elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension is neither diagnosed nor treated. Applicants selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension prevalence (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the condition) assessed for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence. Initially, a rough estimate of the applicant's predicted hypertension prevalence will be calculated using the reported age distribution of their patient population and hypertension prevalence findings from national studies, using the Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool. If the applicant's reported prevalence varies considerably from this rough estimate, the applicant may be asked to describe possible reasons for this disparity during the data validation process. If the reported hypertension prevalence is extreme and there is not a justifiable reason, the applicant may be excluded from further participation in the Challenge.</li> <li>The hypertension control rate should be for the provider's or health system's entire adult hypertensive patient population, ages 18-85, not limited to a sample. The provider's or health system's hypertensive population age 18-85 should include only patients in primary care or in cardiology care in the case of a cardiology clinic. Patients seen only in dental care or behavioral health care should not be included. Examples of ineligible data submissions include hypertension control rates that are limited to treatment cohorts from research studies or pilot studies, patients limited to a specific age range (such as 18-35), or patients enrolled in limited scale quality improvement projects.</li> <li>The applicant's current hypertension control rate among their hypertensive population identified above during the reporting year. In addition, the hypertension control rate during the previous reporting year is also required. If the current reporting year is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, then the previous reporting year is January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.</li> <li>In determining the hypertension control rate, CDC defines \"hypertension control\" as a blood pressure reading &lt; 140 mmHg systolic and &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic among adult hypertensive patients ages 18-85.</li> <li>A description of clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control. Completion of a checklist of sustainable clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control. These may include provider or patient incentives, dashboards, staffing characteristics, electronic record keeping systems, reminder or alert systems, clinician reporting, service modifications, etc. Checkbox responses may be supplemented by a short answer response. Supporting information about clinic systems is encouraged but not required.</li> <li>The applicant must agree to:&nbsp; <ol> <li>Participate in a data validation process (described below), accept the award if selected, and participate in award activities.</li> <li>Complete, without revisions, the CDC contractor's required HIPAA compliance Business Associate Agreement form and/or other forms that may be required by applicable law.</li> <li>Participate in a 1 to 2 hour interview or similar activity to gather information about their hypertension control strategies, and work with CDC on the review of material to share clinical strategies. Strategies used by Champions that support hypertension control may be written into a success story, placed on this website, and attributed to Champions.</li> <li>Assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue or profits, whether direct, indirect or consequences, arising from participation in this prize contest, whether the injury, death, damage or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</li> <li>Indemnify the federal government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to competition activities.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>\n<p>Applicants not agreeing to each of these items on the application form will be excluded from the Challenge. Paper responses will not be accepted. The estimated burden for completing the application form is 30 minutes.</p>\n"

The purpose of this series of competitions is to provide a platform for researchers to&nbsp;develop more advanced differentially private methods that can substantially improve the privacy protection and utility of the resulting datasets.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Databases across the country include information with potentially important research implications and uses, e.g. contingency planning in disaster scenarios, identifying safety risks in aviation, assist in tracking contagious diseases, identifying patterns of violence in local communities. &nbsp;However, included in these datasets are personally identifiable information (PII) and it is not enough to simply remove PII from these datasets.&nbsp; It is well known that using auxiliary and possibly completely unrelated datasets, in combination with records in the dataset, can correspond to uniquely identifiable individuals (known as a linkage attack).&nbsp; Today's efforts to remove&nbsp;PII do not provide adequate protection against linkage attacks. With the advent of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; and technological advances in linking data, there are far too many other possible data sources related to each of us that can lead to our identity being uncovered.</p>\n<h2>Get Involved - How to Participate</h2>\n<p>The Unlinkable Data Challenge is a multi-stage Challenge.&nbsp; This first stage of the Challenge is intended to source detailed concepts for new approaches, inform the final design in the two subsequent stages, and provide recommendations for matching stage 1 competitors into teams for subsequent stages.&nbsp; Teams will predict and justify where their algorithm fails with respect to the utility-privacy frontier curve. In this stage, competitors are asked to propose how to de-identify a dataset using less than the available privacy budget, while also maintaining the dataset&rsquo;s utility for analysis.&nbsp; For example, the de-identified data, when put through the same analysis pipeline as the original dataset, produces comparable results (i.e. similar coefficients in a linear regression model, or a classifier that produces similar predictions on sub-samples of the data). This stage of the Challenge seeks <u>Conceptual</u> Solutions that describe how to use and/or combine methods in differential privacy to mitigate privacy loss when publicly releasing datasets in a variety of industries such as public safety, law enforcement, healthcare/biomedical research, education, and finance. &nbsp;We are limiting the scope to addressing research questions and methodologies that require regression, classification, and clustering analysis on datasets that contain numerical, geo-spatial, and categorical data. To compete in this stage, we are asking that you propose a new algorithm utilizing existing or new randomized mechanisms with a justification of how this will optimize privacy and utility across different analysis types.&nbsp; We are also asking you to propose a dataset that you believe would make a good use case for your proposed algorithm, and provide a means of comparing your algorithm and other algorithms.</p>\n<p><strong>All submissions must be made using the submission form provided on <a href=\"https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge\">HeroX website</a>.&nbsp; Submissions will be judged using the listed criteria and scoring scheme.&nbsp;Challenge Sponsor has the right to make updates and/or make any changes at any time during the Challenge. (see official rules)</strong></p>\n<p>Teams that participate in the HeroX challenge, as well as newly formed teams that did not participate, can proceed to a leader-board-driven competition on Topcoder, the Algorithm Competition \\#1.&nbsp; It is anticipated that Competition \\#1 will be followed by iterating improvements in the Algorithm Sprint, and finish with a final penultimate Challenge to further boost performance in the Algorithm Competition \\#2.&nbsp; Where a competitor's algorithm falls with respect to the utility-privacy frontier curve will determine who wins subsequent Topcoder Competitions.&nbsp; The final review and decision of the judge will be announced in accordance of the rules on this site.</p>\n<h2>Schedule for Stage 1</h2>\n<ul> <li>Pre-registration began:&nbsp; February 1, 2018</li> <li>Open to submissions:&nbsp; May 1, 2018 @12noon ET</li> <li>Submission deadline:&nbsp; July 26, 2018 @ 5pm ET</li> <li>People&rsquo;s Choice Voting:&nbsp; August 14 &ndash; August 28, 2018</li> <li>Winners Announced:&nbsp; September 12, 2018</li> </ul>\n<h2>Registration</h2>\n<p>To register for the challenge competition:</p>\n<ul> <li>Go to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge\">HeroX website</a>.</li> <li>Register with a username and password.</li> <li>Official entries are accepted only through the HeroX platform on or before 5 PM ET&nbsp;August 2, 2018.</li> <li>Registration for Stages 2 and 3 will take place in September and November 2018 through the TopCoder platform.&nbsp; Announcements will be posted to Challenge.gov for the final two 'algorithm' stages.&nbsp; Check back for details.</li> </ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

The Challenge serves as a platform to capture the imaginations of technology and data firms, transportation stakeholders, and state and local agencies to unlock their creativity, and empower them to develop innovative new data visualization tools that can help improve road and rail user safety, to benefit all transportation users. The Challenge is open to individuals and teams (Solvers) from the business and research communities, including technology companies, analytics firms, transportation carriers, industry associations, research institutions, universities, mapping and visualization providers. Solvers will compete for cash prizes that will be awarded throughout the multi-stage Challenge. The Challenge prize purse is $350,000, with four semi-finalists competing for a portion of the $100,000 interim prize and two final-stage Solvers competing for a portion of the $250,000 final prize. The Challenge will begin on June 14, 2018. After the launch, USDOT will accept Stage I submissions up to 11:59 pm EDT on July 31, 2018. A panel of judges will review team submissions and announce Stage I finalists in August 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><u><a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-14/pdf/2018-12795.pdf\">Solving for Safety Solver Solicitation</a></u></li> </ul>\n<p><strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>For more information, and to register your intent to compete individually or as part of a team, visit&nbsp;<u><a href=\"http://www.transportation.gov/Solve4Safety\">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a></u></p>\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p>\n<p>In 2017, motor vehicle traffic crashes resulted in an estimated&nbsp;<u><a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542\">37,150 fatalities</a></u>. Comprehensively, crashes are a societal harm that cost the Nation&nbsp;<u><a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812451\">over $800 billion annually</a></u>&nbsp;in lives lost or injured, as well as lost work productivity and property damage. When the cost of serious crashes is put into context, the weight of this issue becomes much more grave and the need for an innovative, non-traditional approach becomes apparent. Safety is USDOT&rsquo;s number one priority, and we are committed to reducing the incidence of serious and fatal injuries on our roadways.<a name=\"_ftn1\"></a>&nbsp;The USDOT&rsquo;s transportation safety programs have decades of research and design behind them and have proven effective in reducing injuries and fatalities by 40% between 1990 and 2011.&nbsp; In recent years, these advances have leveled off, and new insights and strategies are required to make further advances. Traditional factors do not fully explain the causes of the recent significant increase in traffic fatalities. Increases in driving are one factor; however, the rate of fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) also increased from 1.08 fatalities per 100 million VMT in 2014 to an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542\">estimated 1.17 in 2017</a>.&nbsp;Economic conditions, gasoline prices, weather and other factors are also correlated with increased traffic fatalities. USDOT seeks to reverse the current trend, rapidly detect changes that indicate unsafe conditions, and reduce transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries across the transportation system.&nbsp; The Department is pursuing data-informed decision-making to help strategically prioritize and address transportation safety risks.&nbsp; One pillar of this approach is data visualization.&nbsp; USDOT seeks clear, compelling data visualization tools that make data analysis and insights accessible to policy-makers, transportation providers and the public who make safety choices every day.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></p>\n<p>Currently transportation decision makers have a limited number of analytical visualization tools available that reveal insights, and even fewer focused on safety and prevention of serious crashes.&nbsp; A new opportunity lies in the rapid growth and advancement in technology and analytics markets combined with the volume and variety of transportation and other data now collected by the public and private sectors. For this reason, Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge is looking for the best innovators from the business and research communities, including technology companies, analytics firms, transportation carriers, industry associations, research institutions, universities, mapping and visualization providers, to tackle this challenge.&nbsp; Analytical visualization tools can cast new light on the data to reveal insights not seen though tabular analysis. The Challenge has been created to advance the use of safety data visualizations for answering analytical questions related to surface transportation system safety. In this challenge, Solvers will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative analytical visualization tools to gain insights into fatalities and serious injuries on the U.S. road and rail systems that policymakers, providers, and operators can use to inform the development of safety solutions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Solvers will choose to develop one of two types of analytical visualization tools:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Discover Insights Tools</strong>&nbsp;which analyze data to reveal patterns and trends, and use compelling visualizations to explain what is happening, understand the meaning behind the data, and draw conclusions. These tools often combine disparate data sets and allow a user to ask a question and search for answers visually.</li> <li><strong>Simulation Tools</strong>&nbsp;which assist in decision-making by visualizing data, mathematical, and statistical models to identify issues, determine correlations, and assign probabilities with a degree of accuracy.&nbsp; Developed using existing models and data, including those provided by USDOT and Innovation Agents, this type of tool will allow users to visualize the outputs of model simulations and scenarios, highlighting the different conditions and the results of sensitivity and parametric analysis to visually assist in decision-making.</li> </ul>\n<p>USDOT is looking for Solvers to bring novel concepts and perspectives to existing models and data to develop analytical visualization tools that provide life-saving insights and solutions for transportation safety.&nbsp; Solvers should use innovation and creativity to further define the tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools can range from dashboards using disparate data sets, to spatial analysis via maps, virtual or augmented reality scenarios, image and image analysis, social media mining and beyond. The tools can be powered by models and data provided by USDOT, Challenge Innovation Agents and/or resources to which Solvers have access to through their organizations, partners, and other sources. See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.transportation.gov/solve4safety\">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a>&nbsp;for a sample list of datasets and tools. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Solvers will develop analytical visualization tools to complement existing USDOT projects while addressing one or more of the following safety focus areas:</strong></p>\n<ol> <li><strong>Vulnerable System Users</strong>&ndash; these include non-motorized road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, as well as motorcyclists and persons with disabilities or reduced mobility and orientation, such as those with declining vision and hearing.&nbsp; Ongoing work at USDOT has identified those who are more at risk on the road system, but beyond the police reports and behavior research, pieces of the story that can improve how we protect these users are still missing. Example questions Solvers might address:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Between 2013 and 2016 there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812246\">25-percent increase</a>in pedestrians killed in traffic crashes. A disproportionate share of these pedestrian fatalities involved males, occurred in urban locations, and took place after dark. How can data visualization tools support decision-makers in learning from the relationships among various contributory crash risk factors that are specific to their communities?</li> <li>A Crash Modification Factor (CMF) is a multiplicative factor that indicates the proportion of crashes that would be expected after implementing a countermeasure. Examples of countermeasures include installing a traffic signal, increasing the width of road edge lines, and installing a median barrier.&nbsp; We have proven that different countermeasures work, and we know the CMFs for each countermeasure, but how could we help decision makers choose among appropriate countermeasures?</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Conflict Points Impacts</strong>&ndash; these are locations where user paths intersect, including road intersections and rail grade crossings. Conflict points are categorized as crossing, merging (or joining) and diverging (or separating). We&rsquo;re investigating which conflict points correlate most with motor vehicle crashes, but we don&rsquo;t fully understand the difference between near-misses and impacts at these points. Example questions Solvers might address:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Much of the nation is built around the railroad system. By developing around this infrastructure, we have unintentionally created conflict points that users are drawn to, often putting communities at greatest risk. How can data visualization tools better support urban planners identifying which grade crossings are more prone to accidents and the best risk reduction strategies to employ?</li> <li>In the United States, over the last several years an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/\">average of one-quarter</a>of traffic fatalities and roughly half of all traffic injuries are attributed to intersections. Strategies to address roadway intersection safety are diverse:&nbsp; they are often engineering-based, including geometric design and application of traffic control devices (such as signs, markings and signals) and with a foundation in human factors. Quite often, it is a combination of these strategies that is needed to truly solve a problem. How can we visually compare the safety impacts of traditional signals, roundabouts, and protected left turns?</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>High Risk Factors</strong>&ndash; these include young drivers, impaired drivers, drowsy drivers, older drivers, and speeding drivers. We&rsquo;ve identified high risk factors, but we don&rsquo;t have complete insights on the role of spatial and temporal exposures. Example questions Solvers might address:&nbsp; <ul> <li>There is a misalignment between human behavior and judgment, and roadway and vehicle design. New, young drivers have a higher crash risk than any other age group. How can data visualization tools support and educate people to improve their driving behaviors?</li> <li>In 2015, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 29 percent of the total motor vehicle traffic fatalities. How can data visualization tools support first responders&rsquo; on-site interventions?</li> </ul> </li> </ol>\n<p><strong>Challenge Solvers will also focus their analytical visualization tools by designing them for use by one of the following audiences:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Policy makers and influencers</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;these are people in Federal, State, and local government agencies, associations, and industry bodies.&nbsp; They attempt to reduce transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries by analyzing safety data to identify safety risks and recommending a series of strategies, incentives or disincentives using personnel, funding, or laws and regulations to address them.</li> </ul>\n<ul> <li><strong>Providers/Operators</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; these are people in business and government who build and operate the transportation system.&nbsp; These include vehicle and equipment manufacturers, trucking and rail companies, state and local departments of transportation, law enforcement, and emergency services. They attempt to influence the reduction of transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries by analyzing safety data and designing equipment and facilities, performing system diagnostics, evaluating safety effectiveness, and developing operations, countermeasures and techniques to reduce fatalities and serious injuries for users of the transportation system.</li> </ul>\n<ul> <li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; these are people who use the transportation system or live in the United States.&nbsp; These include motor vehicle drivers, motor vehicle passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; They have an interest in protecting themselves and others in the community who use the transportation system.</li> </ul>\n<p>All ideas will compete against the full pool of entries regardless of the type of tool, safety focus area or audience being proposed. The Challenge invites creative minds from across the Nation to reveal these missing links.&nbsp;The business and research communities have the unique set of skills and creativity to step up and revolutionize transportation safety. The transportation safety community has welcomed innovation, but will benefit further from the perspective and skills of other subject areas. To foster new, novel, and innovative analytical visualization tools, USDOT is looking for Solvers and data from a variety of sectors. The USDOT encourages the participation of Solvers from outside the traditional transportation safety arena who will bring innovative methods, procedures, techniques, and strategies when developing solutions.&nbsp;The USDOT also has an interest in stimulating the integration of new or private sector data sources into the Solvers&rsquo; analytical visualization tools.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE INNOVATION AGENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Challenge Innovation Agents are companies and organizations interested in providing real-world knowledge, guidance, insight, issues, and data to Solvers, especially those new to the transportation safety space.&nbsp; USDOT will provide a public listing of all organizations and companies who identify as Challenge Innovation Agents.&nbsp; This listing will provide a brief description and contact information for each Innovation Agent to assist Solvers that are interested in talking to or partnering with Innovation Agents for the Challenge.&nbsp;USDOT will list two types of Challenge Innovation Agents:&nbsp; Technical Assistance and Data.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Technical Assistance (T.A.) Innovation Agents</strong>&nbsp;can provide interested Solvers with knowledge, guidance, insight and issues related to transportation safety.&nbsp; T.A. Innovation Agents may be able to provide technical assistance related to key safety issues impacting their members or employees, transportation safety techniques, transportation system characteristics, users and operations, approaches from other industries and sectors.</li> <li><strong>Data Innovation Agents</strong>&nbsp;can provide interested Solvers with access to data or analytic techniques that can be used in the analytical visualization tools. Use of a wide variety of disparate data is encouraged to gain insights into reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the U.S. road and rail systems.</li> </ul>\n<p>Challenge Innovation Agents will have the opportunity to explain their expertise and capacity to interested Solvers who will be designing tools that can prove useful in furthering the Innovation Agents or other user&rsquo;s efforts to reduce fatalities and serious injuries.&nbsp; Innovation Agents providing data access will benefit from national recognition and highlight of their data asset, and the exploration and testing of their data by Solvers for use by the transportation safety community. Solvers are encouraged to seek support from Innovation Agents to strengthen their individual/team expertise. Innovation Agents may register their support throughout the Challenge by signing up at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.transportation.gov/solve4safety\">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a>. A list of current Innovation Agents will be updated on the official Challenge website. The Challenge will host a webinar to facilitate Solver-Innovation Agent relationship building.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology has already changed how most of us get around. Let&rsquo;s leverage it to change how we view transportation safety.</strong>&nbsp;The USDOT Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge can act as an engine in driving serious crash reduction. By incentivizing innovation, USDOT will attract the best Solvers from around the nation to come up with new tools for visualizing the risks of serious crashes. As with other government competitions, the USDOT Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge aims to create a vibrant community of thinkers and doers who drive revolutionary innovation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The Office on Women&rsquo;s Health (OWH) is seeking new ways to get health messages out to women and girls. According to the CDC, two out of every three women in the United States are overweight or obese<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>1</sup></a>. This extra weight can lead to many diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and many cancers. Obesity results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including individual factors such as behavior and genetics. Some examples of behaviors that affect weight include diet, physical activity, inactivity, and stress. Improving behaviors in these areas can help women and girls maintain a healthy weight.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, American children today are increasingly unhealthy at earlier ages. According to the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), of girls ages 2-19, 16 percent were overweight and 17.1 percent were obese<a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Many children and teens do not eat properly or exercise enough and as a result, childhood obesity and diabetes are increasingly prevalent. Children with obesity may experience immediate health consequences that can lead to weight-related health problems in adulthood. In addition to physical health problems, overweight and obese children can be targets of social discrimination that can lead to low self-esteem and hinder social and academic functioning.</p>\n<p>Video games are a unique medium to boost knowledge and skills and can lead to behavior change through exploration of cause and effect in a virtual environment. According to a Robert Wood Johnson project called &ldquo;Health Games Research,&rdquo; it was found that digital games can be effective in improving children&rsquo;s health in multiple health topics including physical fitness, health promotion, and disease management<a href=\"http://healthgamesresearch.org/our-publications/research-briefs/Game-Changer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Additional evidence suggests adult learning and behavior change is also possible through gaming. A study in <em>JMIR Serious Games</em> found that women with a higher baseline readiness to change experienced improvement in BMI and nutrition with game play<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2196/games.4977\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>4</sup></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your challenge with this competition is to create an interactive video game with focus on obesity prevention or weight control for women or girls. The game you create will be shared with the general public. The game must address an evidence-based obesity prevention or control strategy. You must show that the game is unlike currently available offerings. The game must be made publically available at no cost as either a web-based or mobile based game available on a widely accessible platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information about obesity prevention or control strategies and guidelines view the CDC&rsquo;s resource here:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/strategies-guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/strategies-guidelines.html</a>.</p>\n<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated and separate prizes will be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\n<p><strong>Dates:</strong> Submissions will be accepted starting January 31, 2019. The submission period for Phase 1 will end on March 31, 2019. The Phase 2 (In-Person Presentation) submission period will be on a date TBD in 2019. The prize winners will be announced at the completion of each phase.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entries not in compliance with the submission requirements outlined below will be ineligible for further review and prize award. During the open submission period, participants must submit the following information to enter the Shape of Health competition:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (Concept Development)&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The first stage of the competition aims to attract a large range of ideas and game developers. The target submission of the first stage will be the conceptualization of the most promising and/or unique game to help support behavior change around physical activity and/or nutrition to prevent obesity in women or girls. The submissions should aim to demonstrate that the proposed game will be accessible to the general public, developed from evidence-based prevention or control techniques, and engaging for women or girls.</p>\n<p>The Phase 1 Submission shall include a comprehensive description of the proposed game in 5 pages or less, including:</p>\n<ol> <li>A one-paragraph executive summary that clearly states how the game will target obesity prevention or control determinants and be developed for a women or girls audience;</li> <li>Link evidence to support the obesity determinant chosen and the theoretical basis for the game (will your game change behavior? improve knowledge? something novel? etc.);</li> <li>A descriptive overview of how the participant arrived at their idea, and why the approach is unlike anything already available;</li> <li>A draft storyboard of the game that describes the game components; and</li> <li>An assessment describing the participant's ability to execute the proposed solution through Phase 2 and to completion.</li> </ol>\n<p>Your Shape of Health competition concept submission must be uploaded on Challenge.gov.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participants may also choose to include additional determinants that contribute to obesity not discussed in the provided resources.&nbsp; If additional determinants are included, the participant should include a short description of how these determinants may contribute to obesity and how this game will addresses these determinants.</p>\n<p>Up to 10 selections will be made in Phase 1 to continue on to Phase 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 (In-person Presentation)</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 2 of the competition builds upon the work of Phase 1 and is focused on prototyping the game, and providing an in-person presentation to a panel of judges. The participants should demonstrate both the evidence base for the intervention and its viability.</p>\n<p>The in-person presentation must include a description of how the following components are incorporated into the game:</p>\n<ul> <li>Relates to women or girls;</li> <li>Targets a determinant of obesity; and</li> <li>Engages the player</li> </ul>\n<p>Selected participants must build out the storyboard submitted in Phase 1 to become a visual presentation of game play. The visual presentation of game play must be recorded into a video and available through a private YouTube link. OWH expects that the participants provide an in-person presentation, which includes a demonstration of the recorded presentation of game play.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be free of security threats and/or malware. Participants agree that HHS may conduct testing on the submission to determine whether malware or other security threats may be present. HHS may disqualify the submission if, in HHS&rsquo; judgment, the software may damage government or others&rsquo; equipment or operating environment or if the game, in HHS&rsquo; judgment, is inconsistent with HHS&rsquo; public health mission, utilizes software or other technologies without appropriate licenses, or any other reason deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>The expectation is that each team will use the prize money from Phase 1 for at least one person to travel to Washington, D.C. to deliver the in-person presentation.</p>\n<p>Up to 2 selections will be made in Phase 2 to continue on to Phase 3</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 (final development)</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 3 builds upon the work of Phase 2 and is focused on the final development of the proposed game and making it available to the general public. Entrants are required to ensure that proper obesity prevention or control determinants are included in the final game.&nbsp; Participants are encouraged to discuss the proper obesity prevention or control determinants with OWH in order to make sure that they are included in the final game.</p>\n<p><strong>Basis upon Which Winners Will Be Selected:</strong> A panel composed of subject-matter experts will judge eligible Shape of Health competition entries.&nbsp; The panel will make winner selections based upon the criteria outlined below and in compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/HHS-COMPETITION-JUDGING-GUIDELINES.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HHS Competition Judging Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>One winner may be selected from each category (1 women&rsquo;s health and 1 girls&rsquo; health).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
