Up to $425,000 will be awarded to winning teams that create haptic interface prototypes that could improve public safety operations.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Public safety officials perform tasks in a variety of environments that severely limit their senses and ability to communicate. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This </span><span lang=\"EN\">challenge seeks to investigate the relevance of haptic interfaces assisting in first responder tasks</span><span lang=\"EN\">, such as monitoring patient vitals, navigating complex spaces with limited visibility, or maintaining situational awareness. </span><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task.</span><span lang=\"EN\"> Contestants will also have the opportunity to demo their initial prototypes with first responders at <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/2019-public-safety-broadband-stakeholder-meeting\">the 2019 Public Safety Broadband Stakeholder Meeting</a> in Chicago, IL.PSCR will assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and level of user satisfaction of the haptic interface prototypes and their ability to assist first responders in conducting their tasks. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge launches March 18, 2019, and concept paper submissions are due April 22, 2019.</span></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><strong><span lang=\"EN\">Challenge Background &amp; Goals</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">One goal of the challenge is to assess the potential of using virtual reality as a development tool to prototype and iterate on designs for public safety technology. Contestants will have the opportunity to enhance their prototypes after interacting with public safety stakeholders and receiving feedback on their designs. </span><span lang=\"EN\">This challenge also seeks to convene members of the haptic provider community and innovators in the development community to advance the state of haptic interfaces for public safety. </span><span lang=\"EN\">PSCR will keep the prototypes for future public safety demonstrations. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Since 2002, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr\">PSCR</a> has collaborated with first responders, stakeholders, and innovators to ensure the development of reliable, intuitive, and mission-focused technologies for the public safety community.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In 2018, PSCR launched their first challenge in the User Interface / User Experience (UI/UX) series focused on advancing interfaces that allow a public safety user to effectively interact with and obtain information from the technology system(s) while ensuring the device is designed around public safety&rsquo;s operational needs. In 2018, PSCR named 6 winners in the Virtual Reality Heads-Up Display Navigation Challenge. </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The contestants, consisting of <strong>Haptic Providers</strong> and <strong>Haptic Development Teams</strong>, and their haptic interface prototypes will be evaluated in two key areas:&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">1) How the prototypes impact a first responder&rsquo;s performance in three virtual reality (VR) scenarios [law enforcement, emergency medical services (EMS), and fire service] and </span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">2) How, once embedded into firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE), the prototypes assist firefighters in a realistic scenario as they navigate and conduct a search and rescue task at a firefighter training facility.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The challenge consists of multiple phases and will require contestants to develop three haptic interface prototypes to be integrated into PSCR-provided virtual reality scenarios as well as a final haptic prototype embedded into firefighter PPE for use in a search and rescue task. After the completion of this challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes from Phase 4 and Phase 5 for future public safety demonstrations. Contestants are encouraged to develop multiple sets of prototypes throughout the challenge, in anticipation of this PSCR keeping the prototypes for demonstrations, and in case the contestants experience technical difficulties during later phases of the challenge.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN\"><span lang=\"EN\"><a href=\"/community-library/1043/PSCR_HapticInterfacesforPublicSafetyChallenge_OfficialRules.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">View the a complete summary of contest phases and key dates</a>.</span></span></strong></p>\n<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>\n",

Further, there are multiple social factors that contribute to poor quality care and increased health care spending.</p>\n<p>AHRQ seeks to better understand unmet health service delivery needs in communities and develop ways to predict these needs at the population level. Understanding population-level behavior in relation to health care decision making is necessary for providing integrated, coordinated, whole person, 360-degree care; yet, information to support decision making about how to provide the quality health care to populations is incomplete. Evidence has suggested that social determinants of health[1] (SDoH) and community service digital data sets add important information that AHRQ may be able to use to better predict and plan for the optimal use of limited resources, improve population health outcomes, and drive savings.</p>\n<h4>Challenge Goal</h4>\n<p>The AHRQ Visualization Resources of Community-Level Social Determinants of Health Challenge seeks tools that support visualizing SDoH data clusters to enhance the research and analysis of community-level health services.</p>\n<p>Participants must develop visualization tools that draw information from at least three or more free, publicly available data source, whether federal, state or local. They may include data from voice and digital assistance requests via service lines, such as 911 emergency services, 311 community services, and 211 personal referrals for community services.  </p>\n<p>A list of these resources are provided on the AHRQ Challenge website.  These tools should be constructed and presented so that AHRQ can apply them in at least two of the following areas:&nbsp; develop studies (data linkage, machine learning, and modeling); relate initial consumer health-seeking behavior; evaluate health status, and; predict needs for emergency, hospital, and community health care services.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1]Healthy People 2020 defines social determinants of health as the conditions in the environments in which people are born, live, learn, work, play, worship, and age that affect a wide range of health, functioning, and quality-of-life outcomes and risks. Conditions (e.g., social, economic, and physical) in these various environments and settings (e.g., school, church, workplace, and neighborhood) have been referred to as “place.” In addition to the more material attributes of “place,” the patterns of social engagement and sense of security and well-being are also affected by where people live. Resources that enhance quality of life can have a significant influence on population health outcomes. Examples of these resources include safe and affordable housing, access to education, public safety, availability of healthy foods, local emergency/health services, and environments free of life-threatening toxins.</p>\n",

Taking place throughout 2019 in ten different cities across the country, the challenge features ten contests which allow for on-line and in-person participation. Each contest is designed to develop new, creative technologies to address issues faced by fire, law enforcement and EMS emergency responders.</p> <p>The Tech to Protect Challenge is designed to engage entrepreneurs, technologists, students, programmers, designers and public safety experts to create solutions across critical technical areas of public safety communications, including secure communications, location-based services, public safety data analytics, mission-critical voice and user interface/user experience (UI/UX). The participant proposed solutions will support emergency responders&rsquo; use of advanced communications technologies in accomplishing their day to day activities, critical responsibilities in emergencies, and beyond.</p> <p>Over the course of 2019-2020, the challenge will include ten unique contests, host ten codeathons in cities across the United States, and award up to $2.2 million in cash prizes to participants. The challenge invites participants of all skill levels; provides opportunities to engage with subject matter experts; and offers access to resources needed to develop viable technology prototypes and solutions. The ten in-person codeathon events will take place in two bursts, September 27-29 and November 1-3, 2019, with the Online Contest launching a rolling application period between June 1 and November 16, 2019. Ultimately, a final national award event will be hosted in April 2020 to showcase and make the final cash awards to the top performing participants.</p> <p>Participants with diverse skill sets and varying levels of experience are welcome and encouraged to participate:</p> <ul> <li>Students, professionals and entrepreneurs with technical and non-technical backgrounds including engineers, computer scientists, software developers, designers, communications experts, illustrators, project managers and others.</li> <li>Emergency responders and others with an interest in public safety communications with technical and operational experience. This includes individuals with field experience, private and public entities that provide communications products or services, and individuals with an interest in software and hardware elements of communications technologies.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to NIST&rsquo;s Public Safety Communications Research Division, several co-sponsors and partnering organizations will be involved in the implementation of the challenge. The co-sponsors generally include public, private, and civic organizations such as technology solution providers, public safety-focused technology companies, public safety agencies and associations, universities, coding academies, and others &mdash; all in support of the participants and the challenge&rsquo;s objectives.</p> <p><strong>Questions?</strong></p> <p>Send an email to:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@techtoprotectchallenge.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">info@techtoprotectchallenge.org</a></p> </div>\n",

            "judging": "<div class=\"judging-criterias\"> <div> <h4>Judging Panels </h4> <p>Three judging panels will operate in a chronological series. Panels will be composed of a diverse group of individuals with specialized skills and experience relevant to the evaluation periods&rsquo; objectives. Each individual judge is appointed by the NIST Director, and required to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and conflict of interest (COI) disclosure to ensure that all participant materials are held in confidence and all judging is fair for participants.</p> <p>The Judge panel consists of experts who will evaluate the participants&rsquo; submissions according to the criteria defined for each contest. The objective of the judging will be to rank and select the top submissions in each period of evaluation. The decisions of the judges for the contest will be announced in accordance with the dates noted in the \"Important Dates\" section of these rules.</p> <p>In support of the judges and the evaluation process, reviewers are subject matter experts covered by NDA and COI requirements, who focus on implementing specific elements of the evaluation process. Reviewers provide evaluation support by assisting with the facilitation of the contests, implementing test and assessment activities, and other processes that generate data for the consideration of the judges, who are responsible for considering all the information and making the final decisions.</p> <p><strong>Panel 1:</strong> Regional Codeathon Judging Panel</p> <p>The Regional Codeathon Judging Panel will be established to support the evaluation of submissions at each Regional Codeathon event. The judges will coordinate between individual codeathon events, in burst 1 and burst 2, to ensure consistency and uniform implementation of evaluation process.</p> <p><strong>Panel 2:</strong> Online Contest Judging Panel</p> <p>The Online Contest Judging Panel will be established to support the consolidated evaluation of online submissions and the &ldquo;best and final&rdquo; updated versions of Regional Codeathon submissions. The consolidated evaluation will be completed between November 16, 2019 and January 27, 2020 through an online judging process.</p> <p><strong>Panel 3:</strong> National Award Event Contest Judging Panel</p> <p>The National Judging Panel will be established to select the National Winners of the Tech to Protect Challenge.

This challenge includes ten unique contests and the evaluation process is designed to be as straightforward and simple as possible for participants to navigate. The graphic below represents the evaluation process that will be applied universally across all contests.</p> <p>Each contest includes evaluation criteria 0-5. Criteria 0 is a basic pass/fail compliance checklist of minimum requirements for submissions. Beyond the minimum requirements check, contests include up to five technical criteria used to evaluate submissions. Each technical criterion is weighted at 10-40 points out of a total of 100 points. Criteria items 0 through 3 will be used to evaluate Regional Codeathon and Online Contest submissions. Criteria items 4 and 5 represent the most advanced criteria items and will be used to evaluate the top submissions from the Online Contest, prior to selecting the National Finalists. Each of these five criteria items represent different features and attributes that the participant submissions will need to clearly demonstrate to the judges. The same evaluation process will be used throughout the challenge, with variation by contest for criteria 4-5. Each contest area has unique criteria, but in general examples may include aspects such as the application&rsquo;s UI/UX operability, accuracy, effectiveness, relevance to the contest&rsquo;s sample use case, and other similar elements.</p> <p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/TTP_evaluation_table.jpg\" width=\"671\" height=\"243\" alt=\"challenge evaluation table\" /></p> </div> <div> <h4>Regional Codeathon Evaluation </h4> <p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Selection of up to the top 4 submissions per Regional Codeathon event.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Selection of one submission per contest (up to ten total) to be recognized at each Regional Codeathon event.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Process:</strong></p> <p>Regional Codeathon submissions will be evaluated by judges and reviewers at the end of each 48-hour codeathon event. <strong>Codeathon submissions will be evaluated against criteria items 0 through 3</strong> for a total of 60 rating points out of 100. A specific judging approach will be followed at the codeathon event, as described below. Participants will not be provided oral or written feedback based on the evaluation of their submissions.</p> <h4>Judging Phases</h4> <p><strong><span>Phase 1 - Initial compliance check</span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> Initial assessment on evaluation criteria /#0 items</span></p> <p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong></p>\n<p>● During the last day of each codeathon event, before the code freeze submission deadline, judges will review the progress of the teams towards meeting the criteria requirements of each respective contest. Judges will complete this initial review by interacting with participants. Judges will ask two questions to each participant. Judges will take notes on the progress of each participant at this stage during this initial assessment.</p> <hr /> <p><strong><span>Phase 2 - Rapid voting at code freeze </span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0-3</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> 3-minute review of each project&rsquo;s capabilities and selection of 4 projects or more to proceed to the next phase of evaluation.</span></p> <p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong></p> <p>● Quick, live demonstrations by the participating teams will be held in person at each participant&rsquo;s station during the rapid voting phase of each Regional Codeathon event. These demonstrations should happen right after the coding freeze deadline and last no longer than 3 minutes each. Participant teams should showcase the capabilities of the solutions and prototypes developed during this phase. SMEs and judges will rotate station to station to review the project demonstrations by the various teams. &lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● SME reviewers and judges will evaluate participant submissions by inputting a simple yes or no for each project in a form provided by the national organizers. These votes should be an approximate reflection of whether the teams have met the criteria items 0 to 3, as described in each of the unique contests.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● These ratings will be utilized to narrow down the list of teams that present projects during the next phase.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <hr /> <p><strong><span>Phase 3 - Judging Part A</span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Participant presentations and judging</span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0-3</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:</span></strong><span> Teams present their projects in front of judges and are evaluated based on criteria items 0 to 3 per unique contest. </span></p> <p><strong>Evaluation Process</strong></p> <p>● Based on the initial voting, judges will invite teams to present their projects through a live presentation and PowerPoint slides. The presentations should take no more than 3 minutes, with an additional 3 minutes being available for questions and answers by the judges.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● Judges will evaluate participant submissions based on criteria items 0 to 3. This evaluation is unique to each contest and may require interactions in addition to the presentation to confirm technical or other elements of the participant&rsquo;s submission.&lt;/span&gt;</p> <p>● Reviewers and judges will evaluate the participant&rsquo;s submission by inputting ratings in a form provided by the national organizers. &lt;/span&gt;</p> <hr /> <p><strong><span>Phase 4 - Judging Part B </span></strong></p> <p><strong><span>Desk review of the submissions and final judging</span></strong></p> <p><span>Criteria \\#0-3</span></p> <p><strong><span>Objective:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Detailed desk review of the submissions by the judges.

PSCR recognizes how cybersecurity affects every aspect of public safety communication. PSCR serves to develop and enhance security solutions to current and future public safety communications.</span> <span lang=\"EN\">This current Challenge complements public safety-specific Federated Identity Credential and Access Management (ICAM) research conducted by PSCR with other <a href=\"http://nist.gov/cyber\">NIST</a> laboratories, such as NIST&rsquo;s Information Technology Laboratory and their National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Challenge will convene first responders, mobile device providers, network providers, authentication providers, researchers, and solvers in order to collaborate and advance the state of mobile device security for public safety. PSCR and their co-sponsors are requesting solvers&rsquo; assistance to explore the possibilities for using the Universal Integrated Circuit Card (UICC), commonly known as the SIM card, as a secure storage container for application credentials.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span>By leveraging solvers&rsquo; outside-of-the-box thinking to create innovative two-factor authentication solutions while educating public safety stakeholders on the benefit of authentication standards.</p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">The SIM card, already used in most mobile devices, has characteristics that make it a robust storage device for critical mobile network subscriber data. The SIM card is a tamper-resistant hardware storage container and, if utilized as an application credential storage container, would enable applications to use the authentication credentials provisioned to it seamlessly. The SIM card offers several usability benefits for public safety, as it would be more user friendly; allow networks to provision credentials over-the-air via a secure channel; and potentially enable device sharing by keeping sensitive information on the removable SIM card. Additionally, as the SIM card is currently used in every mobile device, it could offer cost savings for public safety units as extra hardware would not be necessary.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">This Challenge includes three phases and requires contestants to:&nbsp; securely store a fire on a SIM card; create a mobile application that accesses a user&rsquo;s credentials stored on a SIM card; and authenticates to a FIDO 2 service provider.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Each contestant will be evaluated individually against the listed evaluation criteria, and successful contestants will be invited to move to the next phase. Invited contestants will be awarded cash prizes at the end of Phase 1 ($1,000) and Phase 2 ($2,000) to assist with developing a prototype for Phase 3. The scores from the final phase will be the basis for the final prize challenge awards PSCR will award up to $100,000 to the winners of the Challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">In addition to cash prize awards, contestants will be given the opportunity to obtain feedback from industry, such as the co-sponsoring entities, through planned webinars and other sessions, in an effort to advance both their prototypes and their connections in the public safety and communications technology communities. After the completion of this Challenge, PSCR will keep the submitted prototypes for future public safety demonstrations.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">Should a contestant prove successful, their solution could provide significant time and cost savings for public safety units; for example, the solution would provide:</span></p>\n<ul> <li>Increased security of public safety data on mobile/portable devices;</li> <li>Additional credential storage container without an external, bulky device;</li> <li>Sharing of mobile devices by multiple users by exchanging SIMs;<!-- [if !supportLists]--></li> <li><span lang=\"EN\">Spur ideas for other potential hardware authentication solutions on mobile devices;</span></li> <li>Increased versatility by adding the ability to provision credentials to the SIM card remotely; and</li> <li>Potential cost savings as public safety units would not need to purchase separate hardware authentication tokens.</li> </ul>\n<p><a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/document-library/NISTPSCR_ExpandingtheSIMCardUseforPublicSafety_OfficialRules.pdf\">View the complete summary of contest phases and key dates.</a></p>\n",

How can the government improve collaboration with leading private sector organizations, state and local governments, researchers, academic institutions, Federal government representatives, and the public? We cannot keep solving problems the same way and expect different results.</p> <h4><strong>What is the GEAR Center?</strong></h4> <p>As described in the Delivering Government Solutions in the 21st Century reform plan, <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Government Effectiveness Advanced Research (GEAR) Center</a> could bring together experts in disciplines ranging from economics, to computer science, to design thinking, in order to take a creative, data-driven, and interdisciplinary approach to new possibilities in how citizens and government interact. The GEAR Center can help government modernize to close the gap between government and private-sector services and capabilities. This may also lay the groundwork for where Federal operations and services need to be in five, 10, or 20 years.</p> <h4><strong>What is the Challenge?</strong></h4> <p>This competition challenges \"Solvers\" (participating individuals, teams or legal entities) to demonstrate the usefulness of a GEAR Center model by describing how this model would tackle one or more of the major challenges facing government described in the current <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President's Management Agenda</a> (PMA). For example, how should the government approach the introduction of artificial intelligence into operations? How can agencies more efficiently create a clearing house for matching government needs to relevant project ideas and researchers? Are there new ways to better connect diverse expertise across geographies with Federal agencies who can put that expertise to work in support of their missions? How can Federal agencies better prepare and recruit the Federal workforce?</p> <p>Before the government invests in a future GEAR Center, it is important to first explore the feasibility of creating these types of partnerships and if they can produce the kinds of quality approaches to problem solving the government needs. This competition is designed to reward the top models and execution strategies that will demonstrate a use case of a potential GEAR Center project by building on existing similar efforts.</p> <p>As a first step in formulating the vision for the GEAR Center, in December 2018, the interagency GEAR Team <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/stakeholders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">shared the results of the Request for Information</a>, in which over 40 entities submitted ideas for what a GEAR Center could be and how it might operate. Now, our goal is to recognize high-potential GEAR Center models by awarding prizes to those that can propose a workable GEAR Center model through a demonstration of how that model would creatively address one or more <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/PMA/Presidents_Management_Agenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PMA-related challenges</a> (pg. 4, 7-9).</p> <h4><strong>What is the Prize?</strong></h4> <p>GSA is offering up to three $300,000 cash prizes to the top solutions proposed, as well as selecting up to five additional winners for public recognition. We anticipate that each of the three cash awards will be for solutions that feasibly deliver results tackling different management challenges, but reserve the right to award up to three that propose solutions that address the same PMA-related challenge.</p> <p>Solvers may propose GEAR Center solutions that would:&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Transform the way the Federal workforce is recruited, developed, reskilled or deployed.</li> <li>Empower external users to access and use Government data for commercial and other public purposes.</li> <li>Better connect Federal programs with a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the people they serve, and capture the voice of the customer in order to continuously improve Federal services.</li> <li>Solvers can suggest their own ideas to address issues described in the President's Management Agenda.</li> </ul> <p><strong>On May 13, 2019 we hosted a webinar to answer questions</strong>&nbsp;and allow interested Solvers to connect with experts working on PMA challenges.

Moreover, many businesses not only face a challenge when attempting to find individuals with the technical or hard skills needed to perform the work required by their industries, but also have difficulty finding individuals with the soft skills necessary to be successful in the workplace.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN\">SBA believes that existing Makerspaces are uniquely positioned to help address this problem.&nbsp; The non-profit organization Maker City posits a strong connection between makerspaces and workforce development in U.S. cities, with numerous benefits including:&nbsp; embracing independent work and self-employment, focus on new forms of vocational education, opportunity to focus on &ldquo;jobs in the middle&rdquo; which match makers to those seeking traditional employment, development of new forms of apprenticeship, and a shift to new forms of credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; SBA proposes a pilot program that will utilize existing Makerspaces to provide the necessary job specific and soft skills training and, to the extent feasible, any required industry or trade certifications (the &ldquo;MaTCH Pilot Competition&rdquo;).&nbsp; The goal of the The Makerspace Training, Collaboration, and Hiring (MaTCH) Pilot Competition, upon successful completion of the training program, is to have all program graduates immediately placed in positions with previously identified employers that are in need of skilled labor and have committed to employing a set number of program graduates.</span></p>\n<p>For more information, <a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/match/match-competition-faq\">view MaTCH Competition FAQs</a>.</p>\n",

Prize competition applications consist of a brief twelve-slide presentation and an optional two-minute video.</p>\n<p><strong>OVERVIEW:</strong> SBA is seeking to identify the nation's most innovative and promising small business accelerators and incubators that work with high tech entrepreneurs that are potential SBIR or STTR program applicants (see more information about SBIR/STTR below). These accelerators and incubators help entrepreneurs speed the launch, growth, and scale of their businesses and, ultimately, the creation of jobs. <strong>The Competition awards will infuse the accelerators and incubators with additional resource capital to help these entities provide focused assistance to high tech entrepreneurs, including support for company formation as well as awareness and education of the SBIR and STTR programs.</strong></p>\n<p>For the purposes of this Competition, the accelerators and incubators are referred to as Growth Accelerators (or Accelerators) and include accelerators, incubators, co-working startup communities, or other models to accomplish similar goals.</p>\n<p>SBIR and STTR refer to the Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Tech Transfer programs. &nbsp;These programs provide small businesses with financial capital and research and development funds to develop high-tech, high-growth, commercially viable innovations. &nbsp;Additional information can be found at <a href=\"http://www.sbir.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.sbir.gov</a></p>\n<p><strong>PRIZES FOR WINNERS:</strong> In total, SBA will award up to 60 prizes of $50,000 each, for a total of up to $3 million in prizes under this announcement.</p>\n<p><strong>DATES:</strong> The submission period for entries begins at 12:00 p.m. EDT, June 10, 2019, and ends June 20, 2019, at 4:59 p.m. EDT.

The Waves to Water Prize is a 4-Stage, $2.5M contest to accelerate the development of small, modular, wave-powered desalination systems capable of providing potable drinking water in disaster relief scenarios and remote coastal locations.</p>\n\n<p>This is the second stage of this prize, the DESIGN Stage, which offers competitors up to $800,000 in cash prizes. This DESIGN Stage asks competitors to submit a plan and provide detailed modeling of the system.</p>\n\n<p>The Prize aims to attract dedicated teams of highly capable individuals and provide them with sufficient incentives so that they will advance their technologies through completion of the prize. While the technology development goals of the prize are specifically tailored to address the unique circumstances around disaster response or remote coastal community water needs, the purpose is also to advance technologies that could have broader applications for wave energy and desalination technologies.

Compasses &mdash; both digital and analog &mdash; are oriented by the magnetic force at a user&rsquo;s location. Since geographic and magnetic poles do not align, geomagnetic models like the World Magnetic Model (WMM) correct for this difference.</p>\n<p>As the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field is constantly changing, the difference between geographic and magnetic poles also changes, and the WMM must be regularly updated.</p>\n<p><strong>An opportunity to rethink geomagnetic data collection</strong></p>\n<p>Production of the WMM currently uses space-based magnetic field measurements that the European Space Agency (ESA) Swarm mission has provided since 2013. Swarm mission satellites contain several instruments capable of producing a variety of measurements, including magnetic vector field measurements. To ensure sustainability of the WMM, the U.S. government is taking a proactive approach to identifying new methods of data collection independent of Swarm.</p>\n<p><strong>The World Magnetic Model is used every day around the world</strong></p>\n<p>The WMM is embedded in thousands of systems. More than a billion smartphone users depend on the WMM to point them in the right direction when they use mobile navigation apps. Drivers rely on the WMM to power the compasses in their cars. The WMM is also critical for military and commercial uses around the world. Among other applications, it supports navigation and attitude determination for submarines, satellites, and aircraft, while also informing operational logistics like the numbering of runways.</p>\n<p><strong>MagQuest, a multiphase open innovation challenge</strong></p>\n<p>The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) calls upon solvers to submit novel approaches to geomagnetic data collection for the World Magnetic Model. This open innovation challenge is designed to attract new ideas to increase the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of geomagnetic data collection. With MagQuest, NGA aims to inspire domestic and international solvers to apply their expertise to spaceborne, aerial, terrestrial, and other potential solution areas. Solvers from small businesses, academic institutions, labs, startups, and other organizations are encouraged to enter the competition. (See Additional Resources for an overview of potential solution areas.)</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Phases (Overview)</strong></p>\n<p>MagQuest Phases 1-2 (March 2019 through September 2019) will award a total of $1.2 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1</strong></p>\n<p>In Phase 1, MagQuest sought concepts that proposed novel methods or technologies that may be promising to provide sufficient data for the WMM. Submissions opened March 21, 2019 and closed May 16, 2019. 10 winners were nominated by the judges according to official Phase 1 selection criteria and the total Phase 1 prize pool of $200,000 will be distributed evenly across Phase 1 winners.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 2 is open to solvers from Phase 1, as well as new solvers who did not participate in the first phase of the challenge. Success in Phase 2 may require greater breadth of expertise, and participants have the opportunity to form expanded teams. See the <a href=\"https://www.magquest.com/solver-community\">Solver Community</a> for information on potential team collaboration.</p>\n<p>In Phase 2:</p>\n<ul> <li>The challenge seeks detailed designs and plans for data collection methodologies, including a concept of operations, a description of expected performance and potential risks, and an overview of potential future program management.</li> <li>A successful Phase 2 design will detail all elements of a solution:&nbsp; sensor, platform, and data analysis. The sensor is the instrumentation that makes geomagnetic field measurements, the platform holds or carries this instrumentation, and data analysis refers to the mechanism for processing and distributing data.</li> <li>Submissions will open June 20, 2019 and close August 28, 2019.</li> <li>Educational webinars will be hosted in Phase 2 for interested solvers. Potential webinar topics include an orientation to Phase 2 submissions and teaming information, a technical deep-dive on relevant submission topics, and an overview of regulatory or commercialization considerations. More webinar details will be provided as they are confirmed.</li> <li>Up to five (5) winners will be nominated by the judges according to official Phase 2 selection criteria. The total Phase 2 prize pool of $1 million will be distributed across Phase 2 winners.&nbsp;</li> <li>As part of their acceptance of the associated Phase 2 monetary prize, winners will agree to have a brief synopsis of their concept published on the MagQuest website.</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>Although agencies are adopting secure cloud technologies at record-high levels, challenges remain within the FedRAMP process and across the FISMA and Risk Management Framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.fedramp.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)</a> strives to continuously improve how we support our customers. In an effort to enhance and evolve our program, the FedRAMP Program Management Office (PMO) seeks to leverage the power and insights of the cybersecurity community. Respondents have the opportunity to help guide what the PMO takes on next and ensure that the government keeps federal data secure while bolstering modernization efforts.</p>\n<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>\n<p>Participants should submit bold, innovative, and actionable ideas that offer a new perspective on the FedRAMP Authorization process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Security and cloud professionals, academia, and anyone interested or involved in the FedRAMP ecosystem are invited to participate in this opportunity to share their best thinking on the next phase of FedRAMP.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p>\n<p>As technology evolves, it is important that federal agencies manage information systems to address and mitigate security risks. We want to ensure FedRAMP continuously explores initiatives in support of a modern, efficient, and effective authorization process in an effort to reduce time and cost, without compromising cybersecurity rigor.</p>\n<p>This challenge provides FedRAMP&rsquo;s stakeholders and the cloud security community at large the opportunity to directly inform and contribute ideas in support of a new approach to risk assessments and security authorization for cloud products and services.</p>\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n<p>FedRAMP standardizes the Federal Government&rsquo;s requirements and approach to security assessment, authorization, and monitoring of cloud products and services. The FedRAMP program established several cloud security baselines in accordance with <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ283/PLAW-113publ283.pdf\">FISMA</a> and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A130/a130revised.pdf\">OMB A-130</a> and aligned with the <a href=\"https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/risk-management-framework-(RMF)-Overview\">NIST RMF</a> and <a href=\"https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/specialpublications/nist.sp.800-53r4.pdf\">NIST SP 800-53.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In accordance with FISMA, each agency is required to issue an Authority to Operate (ATO) to authorize operation and accept the risk of using an information system. FISMA, and the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-strengthening-cybersecurity-federal-networks-critical-infrastructure/\">President&rsquo;s Executive Order,</a> require agency heads to be responsible for information security risk within that agency and, while FedRAMP helps streamline and support agency risk determinations, ultimately that responsibility lies with the individual agency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FedRAMP&rsquo;s unified approach allows CSPs to demonstrate how they are safeguarding information using a single set of security requirements that is accepted by all executive branch departments and agencies. This &ldquo;do once, use many&rdquo; approach minimizes duplicative agency-specific authorization efforts, inconsistencies, and cost inefficiencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>FedRAMP works closely with partners from industry and government to promote the secure adoption of innovative information technologies. The FedRAMP PMO takes a continuous improvement mindset to its mission of creating transparent standards and processes to&nbsp; accelerate federal agencies&rsquo; adoption of cloud technologies and ability to leverage security authorizations on a government-wide scale.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How Do CSPs Get a FedRAMP Authorization?</strong></p>\n<p>CSPs can achieve a FedRAMP Authorization for their Cloud Service Offering (CSO) from one of two approaches:&nbsp; through agency partnership or through the Joint Authorization Board (JAB). Regardless of the authorization approach, the CSP and 3PAO must produce the same deliverables (documents, artifacts, and evidence files) to convey the risk associated with the CSO.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/jab-authorization/\">JAB Authorization Process</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/jab-auth.png\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fedramp.gov/agency-authorization/\">Agency Authorization Process</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/agency-auth.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Challenges with the &ldquo;As-Is&rdquo; FedRAMP Process</strong></p>\n<p>As agencies migrate to cloud technology, authorization challenges remain. FedRAMP is committed to providing workable and scalable solutions for our partners to advance the pace of secure cloud adoption. The FedRAMP PMO identified four improvement areas to the current &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; process.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Current Challenges</p>\n<ul> <li>Time - Although there has been significant progress in reducing authorization timelines, more work is needed to improve the pace of authorizing new providers, approving significant changes, and on-boarding of new services.&nbsp;</li> <li>Cost - The technical modifications, testing, and security materials required for a vendor to achieve a FedRAMP Authorization is comprehensive and rigorous.&nbsp; Depending on a vendor&rsquo;s familiarity with these requirements, and the current &ldquo;as-is&rdquo; environment, costs can quickly escalate.&nbsp;</li> <li>Reciprocity - Some agencies are not accepting FedRAMP Authorizations at face-value and require additional security requirements in addition to the FedRAMP baseline. This action transforms the ATO process from a risk-enabling practice to a labor-intensive exercise and loses sight of FedRAMP&rsquo;s intended &ldquo;do once, use many&rdquo; goal.&nbsp;</li> <li>Awareness - There are misperceptions that can potentially dissuade a CSP or Agency from participating in the program. There are several awareness challenges associated with the process, associated roles and responsibilities and available resources, including the <a href=\"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?sort=productName\">FedRAMP Marketplace</a>.&nbsp;</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Helpful Resources and Where to Start</strong></p>\n<p>The FedRAMP PMO launched multiple projects and initiatives in the past in response to customer feedback.

            "judging": "<p><strong>Scope:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The Challenge evaluation will focus on AI/ML technologies that detect malware on an endpoint. The following describes the scope of the candidate technologies:</p>\n<ul> <li>This evaluation is focused on detecting malware at the endpoint. Network-based tools (such as network intrusion detection systems) or network-based systems that reconstruct and analyze files from network traffic are not eligible.</li> <li>Malware detection tools will classify malware on the host:&nbsp; <ul> <li>within the filesystem statically or dynamically, including addition, alteration or replacement of authorized operating system, application, or user files; or</li> <li>with fileless techniques (e.g. identifying fileless malware that sits in memory as executable instructions); or</li> <li>based on other host activities (e.g., logs indicating encrypted command and control communications).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Technologies are expected to have an artificial intelligence and/or machine learning component (e.g., static or dynamic analysis and classifier), with the option to include other complementary approaches, such as signature-based detection.</li> <li>Technologies must operate on-premises, whether solely at the endpoint or in coordination with a local network-level appliance or VM that emulates a cloud analytic capability.</li> <li>To measure how AI/ML improves malware detection, the test data will use public and private benign and malicious samples.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Test Evaluation Process:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation team will review the white papers in order to better understand the tool.&nbsp; The actual test evaluation process of the tool will involve the delivery of multiple file test samples to virtual machines (VMs) running the Participant&rsquo;s malware detection technology. For each test sample (benign or malicious file), the following procedures will be performed on the tool:</p>\n<ul> <li>A VM will be instantiated with the Participant&rsquo;s malware detection technology installed and running.</li> <li>The following information will be recorded for evaluation during a set time interval in which the sample, a file or fileless malware/benign-ware, is present on the VM:&nbsp; <ul> <li>The classification decision for the sample, under the following constraints:&nbsp; <ul> <li>The label must identify whether benign or malicious and be time stamped. In the event there is no label given in the time interval or the tool does not produce a log or result for the sample, the classification will be interpreted as a benign label with maximum timestamp for that time interval.</li> <li>At most one label shall be given per sample. Other peripheral information beyond the required classification decision (e.g. taxonomy, confidence score, etc.) may also be provided, but will not be used in scoring of the Participant technology.</li> <li>The output classification and any peripheral information must be programmatically accessible by the evaluation team. Documentation of the classification logging approach and format must be provided by the Participant. For example, time-tagged logging content may be:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Sent to a logging server/SIEM, such as Splunk.</li> <li>Logged to syslog, a local file, or windows event logs.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Resource usage by only the Participant technology for the duration of the test sample&rsquo;s VM as follows:</li> <li>CPU usage per second</li> <li>Volatile memory usage per second</li> <li>Disk I/O per second</li> <li>Network I/O per second</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the Participant&rsquo;s technology uses an on-premises appliance for dynamic or static analysis, or AI/ML analysis, either via a hardware appliance or a virtual machine, resource usage of the management console will be recorded as well as for the VM containing the test sample. If the on-premises appliance only manages endpoint agents, the usage will <strong>not</strong> be recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>\n<p>Each candidate technology will be scored based on the aggregate performance of their technology when tested against benign and malicious file samples. The score will be in terms of a cost estimate, and will sum the following:</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Simulated attack cost:</strong> A cost function will be used to compute estimated attack costs of each malicious file based on the file&rsquo;s negative effects. The functions will be increasing in time, so that early detection will incur less costs than later detection. Note that in the case of a true positive (correct classification of the malicious sample) only the attack cost up to the detection time is accrued. In the case of a false negative (no alert on a malicious sample) the attack cost for the whole test period will be incurred. For false positive (alerting upon a benign sample) and true negative (correctly not alerting upon a benign sample) scenarios, there is no attack and thus no attack costs will be accrued.</li> <li><strong>Simulated security operator cost:</strong> Costs for handling alerts will be computed. This includes only the costs for handling true positive and false positive scenarios, respectively. These will be estimated from actual manpower costs incurred by security operation centers to triage, investigate, and document host alerts. In the case of the true negative or false negative scenario, there are no alerts and hence no operator costs are accrued.</li> <li><strong>Simulated host resource cost:&nbsp; </strong>Costs for the use of host resources will be accrued throughout the duration of the event. The resources monitored on each host are as follows:&nbsp; <ul> <li>CPU usage per second</li> <li>Volatile memory usage per second</li> <li>Disk I/O per second</li> <li>Network I/O per second</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n<p>The simulated costs of each resource itemized above will be estimated from current rates. These simulated resource costs are accrued regardless of correct (true positive, true negative) or incorrect (false positive, false negative) classification. Note that in the case of a true negative (correctly not alerting on a benign sample), only host resource costs (no attack cost and no operator costs) will be accrued.</p>\n<p><strong>THE WINNERS OF THE CHALLENGE WILL BE THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE LOWEST COMPUTED TOTAL COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCORING ABOVE. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Environment:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The evaluation environment will be VMs. Submitted technologies do not have to be compatible with all tested platforms, but must be compatible with at least one. The two evaluation platforms include the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>Windows 10 Enterprise 64-bit</li> <li>CentOS 7 64-bit</li> </ul>\n<p>The operating systems will have the following additional user software installed as a baseline:</p>\n<ul> <li>Windows:&nbsp; Microsoft Office, Java, Adobe PDF Reader</li> <li>CentOS:&nbsp; OpenOffice, Java, Adobe PDF Reader</li> </ul>\n<p>The host-based endpoint agents must be able to be installed on the Windows VM through either a GUI, console, or powershell using standard Windows installation procedures. On CentOS, an RPM-compatible or RHEL-distribution compatible installer must be provided. Documentation describing the installation procedures should also be provided when submitting the tool, in accordance with the tool submission guidelines provided above.</p>\n<p>If the technology requires an on-premises management appliance or console, then software and/or hardware components for the management appliance should be provided upon submission of the white paper <strong>no later than 30 September 2019 at 1700 EDT.</strong> The components to run the management console must include documentation necessary for installation and a three-month evaluation license if needed. The software and/or hardware components for the on-premises console must be one of the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>Exported Virtual Machine Image (e.g. .ova, .qcow2, etc.) that can be ran with a libvirt-compatible hypervisor (e.g. QEMU, XenServer, VMWare, Virtualbox, Emulab, etc.)</li> <li>Software packages needed to install the appliance, rather than providing the entire virtual machine image.</li> <li>If not an OVA or similar image, a <em>standalone </em>hardware appliance that <em>will not be </em>connected to external cloud services.</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>Phase 1 of the Space Robotics Challenge focused on increasing the autonomous dexterous capabilities of humanoid robots (NASA's R5 robot) in a virtual Martian environment. The final Phase 1 winners were announced in June 2017.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 of the Space Robotics Challenge is seeking to foster the creation or advancement of autonomous capabilities of lunar surface robots. Future ISRU missions may occur on surfaces such as Earth's moon, and will likely need to operate autonomously for long periods of time before, during, and after the presence of astronauts. Robots that can successfully perform ISRU tasks with little to no human intervention are valuable due to both the communication latencies and limited bandwidth between these destinations and Earth. Additionally, NASA has unique constraints for robotic systems in space compared to terrestrial applications, namely the radiation and thermal environments encountered, which affect the processing and sensing capabilities available for robotic systems. It is also recognized that many of the robotic capabilities needed for future exploration missions could have highly valuable functionality for terrestrial robotic applications, such as disaster relief, exploration of difficult and/or dangerous terrains, and industrial plant maintenance and servicing.</p>\n<p>The focus of SRC Phase 2 is on the ability of virtual robotic systems to perform a long-term fully-autonomous ISRU mission for the Moon. This challenge will require competitors to develop software that allows a team of virtual robots (i.e., virtual robotic team) to operate fully autonomously for a specified length of time. The Competition Rounds will be carried out in a robotic simulation format, using Open Robotics Gazebo and Robot Operating System (ROS) platforms.</p>\n",

As billions of people rely on these natural resources and ecosystems to sustain themselves, the potential human impacts are dire, with disproportionate effects on women and girls.</p>\n<p>GBV and environmental issues are interlinked, and so their interactions are complex, diverse, and multi-layered. In some contexts, they form feedback loops where gender-based attacks, harassment, and discrimination worsens the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem resources, and this environmental deterioration triggers new, more damaging forms of violence. In other contexts, preventing and responding to GBV unlocks opportunities for enhanced environmental action, as well as for women's and community empowerment.</p>\n<p>USAID is seeking to fund the innovative application of promising or proven interventions that prevent and respond to gender-based violence across programs that address the access, use, control, and management of natural resources.</p>\n<p><strong>Key Dates:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Launch:&nbsp; 15 August 2019</li> <li>Questions due:&nbsp; 8 September 2019</li> <li>Webinar:&nbsp; 10 September 2019</li> <li>Application deadline:&nbsp; 8 October 2019</li> <li>Finalist interviews:&nbsp; 23 October - 1 November 2019</li> <li>Winner workshop:&nbsp; 18-22 November 2019</li> <li>Winners announced:&nbsp; 20 November 2019</li> <li>Implementation:&nbsp; 22 November 2019 - 31 December 2021</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>Water infrastructure in the United States is critical to the domestic economy, commerce, and resource management. There are thousands of existing hydraulic steel structures (HSS) that require regular maintenance and upkeep. Original methods to protect HSS are disfavored or no longer used due to environmental and safety concerns. Newer approaches to corrosion control suffer from higher costs, shorter service life, and reduced efficacy.</p>\n<p>In order to address rising maintenance costs and to advance the state of the art for corrosion control, the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), is sponsoring this two phase Rust Busters Challenge. This Challenge seeks to identify and develop new methods for corrosion control. The Challenge sponsors are vitally interested in completely new approaches that are outside of conventional thought processes for corrosion control that can be applied to existing structures in situ. There is also interest in advancing existing technologies that can significantly improve service life, reduce costs (through innovative application methods or use of new materials), or improve performance range (through additional features such as health monitoring or self-healing).</p>\n<p>This Rust Busters Challenge offers the opportunity for the most compelling corrosion control approaches to be evaluated and field-tested by the Challenge sponsors. In Phase 1, participants will submit a paper containing the proposed approach to corrosion control, its scientific rationale, and any supporting data. Up to 5 of the most compelling submissions will be selected as Phase 1 winners. Only Phase 1 winners can participate in Phase 2, and each Phase 1 winner will receive up to $50,000 to help support Phase 2 efforts. During Phase 2, participants will demonstrate their technologies using test coupons supplied by Reclamation. Test coupons and/or prototypes will be evaluated by Reclamation, and up to 3 final winners will share the final prize of $100,000. This Challenge has a total prize purse of $350,000 ($250,000 in Phase 1 and $100,000 in Phase 2). It offers a rare opportunity for Phase 2 participants to receive field-test data for their technologies and additional possibilities to continue working with Reclamation to further develop their technologies.</p>\n<p><strong>KEY DATES</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Pre-Registration:</strong> August 22 &ndash; September 19, 2019</li> <li><strong>Phase 1 Key Dates (anticipated)</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Submissions:</strong> September 19, 2019 &ndash; January 16, 2020</li> <li><strong>Judging:</strong> January 2020 &ndash; February 2020</li> <li><strong>Phase 1 Winners Announced:</strong> March 2020</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Phase 2 Key Dates (anticipated)</strong> <ul> <li><strong>Prototype Development:</strong> March 2020 to September 2020</li> <li><strong>Prototype Testing and Evaluation:&nbsp; </strong>September 2020 to December 2021</li> <li><strong>Best in Lab Performance Winner Announcement:</strong> March 2021</li> <li><strong>Phase 2 Winner Announcement:</strong> December 2021</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n",

Through 12-week sprints, TOP challenges technologists outside of government – companies, non-profits, and universities – to create digital tools with Census and other federal open data to expand American economic opportunity.</p>\n<p>TOP works with experts from the Census Bureau and other federal agencies to identify high-priority challenges facing the public, and then engages experts from the private and nonprofit sectors through technology development sprints. Each 12-week sprint results in new data-driven tools that directly serve families, local leaders, and businesses. This process helps to empower people with technology, make government data more accessible and user-friendly, and facilitate cross-sector collaboration to build new digital solutions with open data. </p>\n<p>Since launching in 2016, 30 federal agencies and over 100 external organizations including companies, universities and community organizations have worked together to create 80 new digital products for the public.  These products provide solutions to challenges including the opioid crisis, disaster response, connecting veterans with jobs, promoting STEM education, and more. </p>\n<p>TOP supports the Census Bureau’s mission and Title 13 mandate to disseminate data to the public. It is also a component of the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Presidents-Management-Agenda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">President’s Management Agenda</a> — namely, <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/CAP/leveragingdata/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cross Agency Priority (CAP) Goal 2:&nbsp; Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset</a>, championed by Commerce Deputy Secretary Karen Dunn Kelley, which focuses on utilizing data as an asset to grow the economy, increase the effectiveness of the Federal Government, promote transparency, and make government data more useful to the public, businesses, and researchers. TOP is also a <a href=\"https://strategy.data.gov/proof-points/2019/04/26/helping-baltimore-volunteers-find-where-to-help/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Proof Point</a> within the first ever <a href=\"https://strategy.data.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Federal Data Strategy</a>.</p>\n<h4>The Problem</h4>\n<p>Over 9 sprint cycles and nearly 4 years, it has become clear that one of the greatest challenges associated with civic technology development is product sustainability and adoption – in short, what happens to these solutions after The Opportunity Project sprint process. Now, in order to help advance some of the most promising technology solutions developed through The Opportunity Project, the Census Bureau is launching a Prize Challenge to help tech teams deploy their technology solutions, ensure they reach end users and drive impact on the critical problems they aim to solve. This prize challenge is open to teams that have previously participated or are currently participating in The Opportunity Project, and built a digital product with open data through an Opportunity Project facilitated sprint or utilizing <a href=\"https://opportunity.census.gov/toolkit.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Opportunity Project toolkit, which provides a step-by-step outline for replicating the sprint process</a>. <strong>The Census Bureau is conducting this challenge under the authority of and in accordance with the America COMPETES Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</strong></p>\n<h4>Challenge Goals and Categories</h4>\n<p>The Opportunity Project Prize Challenge is a new opportunity for teams who have participated in The Opportunity Project to compete for funding to expand their impact, deploy tools to end users, and begin to or continue to deliver impact on critical problems facing the public.</p>\n<p>Because the challenges tackled in The Opportunity Project to date are so broad, COIL has identified five categories that capture a range of critical problems, described below. Teams applying for the prize must submit their product in at least one category, and can submit in up to 2 categories. </p>\n<ol> <li><strong>2020 Census:&nbsp; Reaching Hard-to-Count Communities</strong>:&nbsp; e.g., products focusing on challenges such as increasing response rates in hard-to-count communities, bridging the digital divide, promoting online self-response through digital literacy, and promoting 2020 Census jobs;</li> <li><strong>Revolutionizing the Workforce:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as employment, training, education, supporting entrepreneurship, creating multiple pathways for careers, and developing regional talent pipelines for high growth development; </li> <li><strong>Building Thriving Communities:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as affordable housing, transportation information and infrastructure, public safety, investment in communities, and community infrastructure development;  </li> <li><strong>Creating Resilient People and Places:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as disaster preparedness and response, environmental stewardship, and local address databases to support first responders and other community needs; </li> <li><strong>Creating the Future of Health:&nbsp; </strong>e.g., products focusing on challenges such as the opioid crisis, connecting patients with clinical trials, public health and disease prevention, emotional wellbeing, and tick borne diseases.</li> </ol>\n<p>**If you missed the May 21 Informational Webinar on The Opportunity Project Prize Challenge, you can view the recording at <a href=\"https://www.uberconference.com/getmp3/AMIfv95Ryev7gx3KRzgJRi2_Ga3R1PhHVB4_foRTTZ-UxzP1MQdrmxvbBo2CrxOYkkg_nt8t8UPfxxHHlKBC5xZYKF6LxgdrE09G0uvwf6zY0bHpK0TZYYPOIW161HG7JCB24zW2xwWNxc2Vob87dlXTUE0xK5B9_A.mp3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this link</a>.** </p>\n",

Input images are square RGB image files in PNG format, with height and width of 1024 pixels. Pre/post pairs are identified by matching numerical IDs for each set of pre/post filenames. For the training data, filenames also include information about the disaster, but disaster information is obfuscated in the test dataset.</p>\n<p><strong>Outputs</strong></p>\n<p>Your model must predict an output PNG image with height and width of 1024 pixels, where each pixel value corresponds to the predicted class at that place in the input image:</p>\n<ul> <li>0:&nbsp; no building</li> <li>1:&nbsp; undamaged building</li> <li>2:&nbsp; building with minor damage</li> <li>3:&nbsp; building with major damage</li> <li>4:&nbsp; destroyed building</li> </ul>\n<p>Localization is scored against the building polygons annotated in the \"pre\" images, at each pixel location. Damage classification is scored against the damage levels annotated in the \"post\" images, at each pixel location.</p>\n<p><strong>Baseline model</strong></p>\n<p>A public baseline model is currently being evaluated to establish public benchmark performance levels. The code and results for the baseline model will be available soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Upload Your Predictions</strong></p>\n<p>The first step in a submission is uploading your predictions for the test dataset, which you should compute offline on your own. Download the test dataset, compute a prediction for each of the instances in the test set, and then upload your predictions for evaluation and display on the public leaderboard. You may elect to upload submissions anonymously, which will display \"Anonymous\" for that submission on the leaderboard. Solvers may upload one submission at a time; a maximum of three submissions per day will be evaluated. Baseline models are currently being evaluated to establish public benchmark performance levels; leaderboard functionality will be available soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Submit your Container for Verification</strong></p>\n<p>The best results on the leaderboard will be eligible for online container verification; a successful container verification is required to complete a submission and be eligible for awards. To submit your container for verification, you must containerize your code to compute one prediction, push your container to Docker Hub in a public or private account, authorize the Challenge Sponsor to pull your container, and then use the form to submit a container verification job. If the results of your container evaluation are the same as your previously uploaded predictions, your container is successfully verified. A tutorial and further details will be available when leaderboard functionality is active. Container verification submissions may be made from public or private repositories. Container verification is part of the submission process, and a successful container verification is required to be eligible for awards.</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation Metric</strong></p>\n<p>The overall ranking metric for the xView2 Challenge is combined F1 score. Submissions are evaluated over the test dataset to compute a localization F1 score and a damage classification F1 score. Localization F1 scores the agreement between your predictions (0 = no building, or 1-4 = building) at each pixel location versus the ground truth labels for the \"pre\" image. Damage classification F1 scores the agreement between your predictions (1 = no damage, 2 = minor damage, 3 = major damage, 4 = destroyed) over the pixels of each building polygon in the ground truth of the \"post\" images. The overall F1 score is 30% localization F1 + 70% damage classification F1.</p>\n",

American businesses that employ and support workers with disabilities see improved performance over their industry peers. On average these firms have:</p>\n<ul> <li>28% higher revenue, double the net income, and</li> <li>30% higher economic profit margins compared to businesses that did not engage in disability employment and inclusion efforts.<sup>1</sup></li> </ul>\n<p>In addition, companies that employ and support workers with disabilities were twice as likely as companies that do not to have higher total shareholder returns than their peers.&nbsp; Further:</p>\n<ul> <li>Innovation leads to the development of products and programs that are accessible for all.</li> <li>Investors increasingly scrutinize company culture and diversity, including disability inclusion, in investment decisions.</li> <li>Inclusive business environments often see improved productivity levels with the addition of employees with disabilities.</li> </ul>\n<p>People with disabilities also are an important population for businesses that are working to achieve greater diversity and inclusion of their workforce. With this challenge, ACL is seeking commitments from businesses to include employees with disabilities, particularly with intellectual and developmental disabilities, in their inclusion and diversity efforts and their talent pipeline programs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the workforce pipelines proposed here will enable businesses to benefit from the talents of a wider, more diverse workforce and ensure more Americans with disabilities are able to advance and compete in the future economy.&nbsp; ACL recognizes that businesses &ndash; from Wall Street to Main Street &ndash; are critical partners for identifying and testing solutions to this challenge.</p>\n<p>The challenge will take part in phases, with cash prizes awarded in each phase:</p>\n<ul> <li>Phase 1, beginning in Fall of 2019, seeks proposals from competitors who aim to innovate and tailor the pipeline models to include individuals with IDD.</li> <li>Phase 2, beginning in Spring of 2020, participants will be asked to conduct small scale feasibility testing on the selected workforce pipeline models.&nbsp; Teams will convene in Washington, D.C. to propose their ideas to a panel of judges who will help select winners.&nbsp; Judges will have expertise in increasing access into the labor force for people with disabilities.</li> <li>Phase 3, beginning in Summer 2020, will examine the replicability, scalability, and long-term sustainability. Teams will again convene in Washington, DC, and the Grand Prize winner will be announced in October of 2020..&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul>\n<p>ACL is looking for innovative workforce pipelines that:</p>\n<ul> <li>Serve people with a wide range of disabilities, including individuals with IDD;</li> <li>Redefine career development requirements and pathways using non-traditional methods;</li> <li>Innovate and incorporate pipeline components that specifically address the employment barriers for the IDD community;</li> <li>Include individuals from the IDD community throughout the development and testing of models;</li> <li>Include a business commitment to implement the model for Phase 2 (small scale testing) of the challenge; and</li> <li>Lead to competitive, integrated employment.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p>\n<p>A challenge (also referred to as \"prize challenge,&rdquo; \"competition,\" \"prize competition,\" \"incentive prize\" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>\n<ol> <li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li> <li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li> <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li> </ol>\n<p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>\n<p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>\n<ul> <li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li> <li>Reach wide communities of experts</li> <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li> <li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li> <li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li> </ul>\n<p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp; <u><a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/\">https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/</a></u></p>\n<p><strong><u>Today&rsquo;s Workforce for Americans with Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</u></strong></p>\n<p>With the nation&rsquo;s strong economic growth and historically low unemployment rates, America&rsquo;s business leaders are actively searching for diverse and talented workers to build an inclusive and dynamic national workforce.&nbsp; Despite the more than seven million unfilled jobs, unemployment among Americans with disabilities remains above 70%.&nbsp; For Americans with intellectual and developmental disabilities, the number is even greater with 82% remaining out of the workforce.&nbsp; For individuals with IDD who are employed, data consistently show that the majority work part-time in entry-level positions, have low income, and have limited access to employee benefits.&nbsp; In addition to these gaps, many career tracks are often not accessible to the IDD community because of requirements such as completion of higher education or having a driver&rsquo;s license; many of these requirements are not necessary to succeed.</p>\n<p>In today&rsquo;s thriving and competitive market, businesses across the United States are providing innovative and competitive opportunities to workers to develop new skills and enter into career-tracked jobs.&nbsp; From apprenticeships and training programs, to leadership rotational programs, and integrative internships, employers are developing pipelines for recruiting and retaining talent.&nbsp; Paired against the deep bench of talent from the population of Americans with disabilities, there is current opportunity to develop and expand employment recruitment and workforce pipeline programs to target, train, and retain the talents of workers with disabilities, including those with IDD.</p>\n<p><strong><u>The Opportunity to Modernize Employment Recruitment, Training, and Retention for Americans with Disabilities</u></strong></p>\n<p>How does a company pave the way in the area of disability employment and inclusion?&nbsp; Most success stories showcase companies who bring creativity and innovation to the process of recruitment and training for hiring and retaining people with disabilities.<sup>1</sup> One example includes how technology firms have examined the initial barrier to why people with autism were not getting placed in jobs, and at least one is now partnering with a local company to bring in qualified candidates for a week-long academy of training and technical exercises.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there are effective ways of building the pipeline to employment for people with disabilities, current best practices in workforce recruitment and training for individuals with IDD require some innovative components such as spending time with individuals in community settings, working with families, and negotiating job responsibilities with an employer.</p>\n<ol> <li>American Association of People with Disabilities &amp; Disability:IN (2018).

            "description": "<p>The Safeguard with Autonomous Navigation Demonstration (SAND) Challenge will be an opportunity for small businesses to compete in an autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle competition. The challenge will address some of the safety critical risks associated with flying UAVs in the National Airspace system (NAS):&nbsp; 1) flight outside of approved airspace and 2) unsafe Proximity to people or property.</p>\n<p>Beyond visual line of sight operations (BVLOS) is the holy grail of UAV operations. The stretch goal of the SAND challenge is to demonstrate that UAVs integrated with NASA Langley’s patented geo-fencing technology, Safeguard, can operate safely beyond visual line of sight in the NAS. NASA Langley’s patented Safeguard technology is designed to assuredly address the aforementioned safety critical risks and will fly onboard the competitor’s vehicle while navigating the competition course. Safeguard is NASA’s patented aviation quality geo-fencing technology. Safeguard is a verified and validated independent system that uses real-time data about the position of a UAV to determine its proximity to a set of pre-defined and pre-loaded lateral boundaries and an altitude limit.</p>\n<p>The SAND Challenge will demonstrate the successful integration of the NASA Safeguard technology in the context of a post-natural disaster scenario amidst critical infrastructure. The SAND Challenge will be held in May of 2020 in Hampton, Virginia.</p>\n<p>The primary objectives of the SAND Challenge are:</p>\n<ul> <li>To demonstrate safe operations of autonomous UAVs amidst critical infrastructure in a simulated post-natural disaster scenario using NASA Langley’s Safeguard Technology to stakeholders, the emerging UAV industry, and the public.</li> <li>To collect post competition data from Safeguard for further analysis that may inspire new regulatory policies that support expanded use of commercial UAV systems.</li> <li>To inform regulatory stakeholders including federal, state, and local governments on the potential operational benefits of integrating NASA Langley’s Safeguard Technology to UAVs to aid first responders in natural disasters events.</li> <li>To engage the emerging UAV operator market to the value proposition of NASA Langley’s Safeguard Technology and its potential use cases for commercialization and licensing.</li> </ul>\n<p>The small business competitors will develop their own autonomous logic implemented on their drones to provide surveillance and identification of key targets in a simulated post-natural disaster scene.

Please visit <a href=\"https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/static-page/white-nose-syndrome-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/static-page/white-nose-syndrome-challenge</a> for more information.</h3>\n\n<p>Hibernating bats in North America are in trouble. An invasive fungus, <em>Pseudogymnoascus destructans</em>, that causes a disease called white-nose syndrome is spreading across the continent and killing millions of bats. Bats eat insects and are integral to thriving ecosystems. With the loss of millions of bats because of this deadly fungus, many millions more forest and agriculture insect pests are left to feed on trees and crops, ultimately affecting the balance of nature and even human health.</p>\n<p>There is no known cure for white-nose syndrome, but scientists from all over the world are working together to study the disease, how it spreads and infects bats and what we can do to control it. Much of this work has been done under the umbrella of the United States’ National Response to White-nose Syndrome, a broad, multi-agency effort led by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Bat-image-2.jpg\" alt=\"Bat affected by white-nose syndrome\" /></p>\n<p>The White-nose Syndrome Prize Challenge seeks ideas that may lead to a permanent solution to this crisis of wildlife health by eliminating, weakening, or disarming the fungus that causes it.</p>\n<p>The White-nose Syndrome Challenge specifically seeks ideas that can permanently eliminate, disarm, or weaken <em>P. destructans</em> in the wild. Through the challenge, we invite ideas that can lead to solutions to reduce the effects of the fungus without harming other beneficial species or the environment. We are seeking ideas that can be employed in the field in the near future and benefit many of the affected species across their ranges.</p>\n<p>Ideas recognized through this Challenge will be the focus of future collaborations to establish an appropriate research and development plan to bring the envisioned tools to fruition. Experts in relevant fields, including members of winning teams, if appropriate, will come together to identify critical research and technology needs to develop the solution.</p>\n<p>After that, qualified scientists, designers and engineers will have an opportunity to apply to do this work and develop prospective tools for use. Once ready, we hope the tool(s)will be used throughout the country to improve survival of bats susceptible to white-nose syndrome.</p>\n<p>A webinar for interested solvers will be held on November 20, 2-3 p.m. ET.

            "description": "<p>In June 2017, the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) put on the first Agile Robotics for Industrial Applications Competition (ARIAC). The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers. For the second and third year of the competition, we introduced a cash prize to motivate and expand participation. This is the fourth year of the competition.</p>\n<p>In this context, agility is defined broadly to address:</p>\n<ul> <li>Failure identification and recovery, where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically recover from those failures</li> <li>Automated planning, to minimize (or eliminate) the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li> <li>Fixtureless environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts that are not in predefined locations</li> </ul>\n<p>The competition Participants are required to develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot in a simulated environment. Gazebo (gazebosim.com), which is an open source robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing platform and the Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software libraries and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.</p>\n<p>Software interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants to control the robot.  The qualifier will begin in the April 2020 timeframe with the final competition occurring in mid-May 2020. The competition will be performed virtually, so physical attendance is not required to compete. NIST is intends to propose a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow the winning Participants to present their approaches; details, when available, will be posted to the official challenge website.</p>\n<h4>Dates of the Competition:</h4>\n<ul> <li>Accepting Qualifier Submissions Through:&nbsp; April 3, 2020</li> <li>Qualifier Begin:&nbsp; April 6, 2020</li> <li>Qualifier End:&nbsp; April 10, 2020</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Begins:&nbsp; May 11, 2020</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Ends:&nbsp; 5:00 PM, EDT (UTC-05:00), May 15, 2020</li> <li>Announcement of Cash Prize Winners:&nbsp; late May 2020</li> </ul>\n",

            "judging": "<h4>Judging Panel</h4>\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>\n<h4>Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</h4>\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant's final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\n<h4>Cost Metrics</h4>\n<p>The following values are calculated for a Participant’s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials.</p>\n<p>The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The final cost for individual sensors will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the Finals. For planning purposes, Participants should use:&nbsp; </p>\n<ul> <li>$500 for each logical camera used.</li> <li>$100 for each other sensor used (e.g., break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li> </ul>\n<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be compared to the average of all the team costs and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as TC, and the average team cost is designated as AC. There is also a factor (m) for the cost factor to magnify the difference between the cost factors of each team, which is initially set at a value of 3. The final m value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals. The cost factor, is then calculated as:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/cost-metric-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"cost metric equation\" /></p>\n<h4>Completion Score</h4>\n<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the box. The completion score, CS, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the box. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the box and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order kj with i products in it would have a maximum score of:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/completion-score-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"completion score equation\" /></p>\n<h4>Efficiency Factor</h4>\n<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first kit is completed and is designated as T01. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, Ti is counted in seconds from the time that the ith order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times for each team (ATi) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/efficiency-factor-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"300\" alt=\"efficiency factor equation\" /></p>\n<p>If a team’s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.</p>\n<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, h, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final h value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>\n<h4>Trial Score Calculation</h4>\n<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/trial-score-calculation1-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"scoring equation for each trial\" /></p>\n<p>For the trials where there is no second, higher priority, order, the following modifications are used:&nbsp; CSK2 = CSK1 , EF2 = 0. This results in the simplified scoring equation:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/trial-score-calculation2-ariac-2020.png\" width=\"450\" alt=\"modified scoring for each trial\" /></p>\n<h4>Final Score Calculation</h4>\n<p>The final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Kit Building, Dropped Part, and In-Process Kit Change scenarios, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Winners:&nbsp; </strong>The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>Judging Criteria</h4>\n<ul> <li><strong>Overall Performance based on the scoring metrics described above (80 points). </strong>Using the scoring metrics described herein, the first-place entry will be award 80 points, the second-place entry will be award 70 points, the third place entry will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li> <li><strong>Novelty of approach and alignment with spirit of competition (20 points). </strong>At the judges’ sole discretion, up to 20 points will be awarded for entries that show novel approaches to solving the agility challenges and whose approaches are consistent with the spirit of the competition of coming up with industrially-implementable approaches that will help industry make better use of their robotic platforms. Each entry is eligible for up to 20 points, and more than one entry can receive all 20 points (or any other value). </li> </ul>\n<p>NIST will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists that have been awarded a cash award (each, an \"Award\"). The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST's sole discretion. Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>\n<p>The winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as \"undeliverable\" will result in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified in the winning entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an entry through that representative. The list of entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>\n<p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>\n<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition entries are to be borne by Participants.</p>\n",
            "how-to-enter": "<p>An interested Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering at the ARIAC website. The party is then given access to view the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants will be notified by email.</p>\n<p>Once registered, the Participants are eligible to participate in the qualifier. The qualifier will occur in the April 2020 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants must complete the qualifier to be eligible to compete in the final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifier to be eligible for the final competition.</p>\n<p>Participants will run the qualifier from their own location. They will have two weeks from the date that the qualifier is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants will be emailed when the qualifier is released. They should run the qualifier at their own location and submit the resulting output files generated by their control system (listed below). Their output files should be uploaded to an account (nfiles.nist.gov) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant.</p>\n<p>Specific files that need to be submitted include:</p>\n<ul> <li>Their environment configuration file specifying your choice of sensors.</li> <li>A performance log file that contains information about the task completion.</li> <li>A simulation state log file that contains information about the state of Gazebo during the trial.</li> </ul>\n<h3>Competition Scenarios</h3>\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document:</p>\n<ul> <li>Order:&nbsp; A list of parts and their goal location on a tray.</li> <li>Part:&nbsp; One element of an order.</li> <li>Tray:&nbsp; A surface that hold parts.</li> <li>Kit:&nbsp; A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li> </ul>\n<p>ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>\n<p>There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Scenario 1:&nbsp; Baseline Kit Building:&nbsp; </strong>The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will receive an “Order” that details the list of parts and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</li> <li><strong>Scenario 2:&nbsp; Dropped Part:&nbsp; </strong>The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots’ gripper. The robots will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</li> <li>Scenario 3:&nbsp; In-Process Kit Change:&nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;While the robots are in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</li> </ul>\n<h3>Fifteen Trials</h3>\n<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials:&nbsp; 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\n<h4>Robot Arm</h4>\n<ul> <li>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal Robots UR10.</li> <li>The robot arms’ position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted.</li> <li>The end of the arms are equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</li> </ul>\n<h4>Sensors</h4>\n<p>A Participant can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score. A sample of available sensors may include:</p>\n<ol> <li>Break beam:&nbsp; reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li> <li>Laser scanner:&nbsp; provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li> <li>Cognex logical camera:&nbsp; provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li> <li>Proximity:&nbsp; detects the range to an object.</li> </ol>\n<h4>Order</h4>\n<p>An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete. Each order will specify the kit to be assembled, (i.e. the list of parts to be put in the kit). Each specified part has the following structure:</p>\n<ul> <li>The type of part.</li> <li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li> </ul>\n<h4>Faulty parts</h4>\n<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts:&nbsp; they will not count for any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts bonus if left in trays.</p>\n<h4>Competition process</h4>\n<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\n<ul> <li>The robots programmatically signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li> <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li> <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li> <li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method, up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li> <li>In the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li> <li>The robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality control.</li> <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li> </ul>\n"

            "description": "<p>The goal of this challenge is to develop a job-matching tool that will be piloted in a <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/tap\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Transition Assistance Program (TAP)</a> Employment Workshop at selected base locations. If the tool is effective, it could be added to the Employment Workshop curriculum for all transitioning service members.</p>\n<p>In 2018, the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) began a cross-agency effort to understand the transition of a Service member from active duty to civilian employment, from the perspective of the individual navigating this process—not the perspective of the Federal organizations that exist to support a plethora of programs. <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/mapping-cx-journey/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The agencies built a journeymap of this process and found a recurring theme:&nbsp; navigating the “sea of support” and resources relating to the job search can be a challenging task.</a></p>\n<p><img style=\"width:500px; float:right;\" src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Vets-Employment-Challenge-sealsV1.jpg\" alt=\"Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Department of Defense seals\" /></p>\n<p>Veterans complete their military service with unique and technical skillsets that bring value to all sectors of the economy, but can encounter challenges framing their experience and skills for civilian employers. American businesses report that they are also missing an opportunity to attract and retain a capable, competent workforce, and recognize the value in veterans and spouses.</p>\n<p>Many job boards, veteran hiring programs, and other initiatives exist, but there are disparate platforms of valuable data. Traversing across these resources can be overwhelming for both first-time job-seeking veterans and businesses with limited time to fill urgent needs. Additionally, most job search tools for Service members are based purely on military occupational specialties, which do not accurately represent the breadth of experiences many individuals have. Finally, small businesses in particular do not have the staff capacity to build out robust skills profiles that better describe hiring needs.</p>\n<p>There is a need for both a more sophisticated matching mechanism and a simpler interface that can pull from existing data sources (from Federal platforms like <a href=\"https://www.onetonline.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">O*NET</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.militaryonesource.mil/military-life-cycle/separation-transition/employment-education/credentialing-your-military-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Credentialing Opportunities On-Line (COOL) program</a>, and the <a href=\"https://veterans.usnlx.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Labor Exchange</a>, to LinkedIn profiles, resumes, or job descriptions that individuals and businesses have created).</p>\n<p>The Government wants to be mindful of not prescribing what the platform should look like or how it will work, but wanted to note some of what job-seekers and Federal employees have shared throughout the research process of designing this competition. In particular, the agencies heard a need for:</p>\n<ul> <li>A matching-oriented application for the job-searching process. A platform that could determine likeness of fit, reveal matches, and allow both the employers and job-seekers to opt-in and share more information with each other and potentially interact more (connecting with Veterans at the company, chatting, etc.).</li> <li>A platform that has functions like a “ZocDoc” for job searching. Employers can self-input information (like doctors input their location, office hours, and information about their practice), external reviews from users are included, and users can actually take an action (book an appointment) in one place.</li> <li>A one-stop-shop verification system of employers. Employers on the platform could be matched automatically with databases that note if they are Federal contractors, have earned a <a href=\"https://www.hirevets.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HIRE Vets Medallion</a>, or display information to help form a profile indicating whether the employer is who it claims to be (e.g., Google/Glassdoor/Yelp/Better Business Bureau/etc.).</li> </ul>\n<p>This competition is divided into phases that will enable Solvers to further engage users in their design process and gather feedback on working prototypes. The most important requirement of this competition is that the platform solves challenges faced by the actual users, understanding what’s most useful and helpful to them, rather than being tool-led.</p>\n<p>Here is some of what we heard about the gap that exists:</p>\n<h4>Job-Seeker Needs</h4>\n<ul> <li>Ability to filter opportunities that match skillsets based on personally important components such as benefits offered, location, and culture.</li> <li>Recommendations of opportunities outside occupational analysis, if necessary, to describe the skills and role in a familiar manner that Service members better understand.</li> <li>Confidence in individual privacy and data protections at the highest standard.</li> <li>Ability to “Turn on / Turn off” when you’re looking for opportunities.</li> <li>Ability to control what information is shared with employers of potentially “matched” opportunities (e.g., if you match with an opportunity, what level of information is shown to an employer to either contact you or learn more about you).</li> <li>Ability to take an action directly (such as API to apply for a job or contact an employer)—minimizing the need to update multiple platforms or re-enter data multiple times.</li> <li>Ability to connect with other veterans at a specific company.</li> <li>Ability to easily remove a particular profile and all related data from the platform.</li> </ul>\n<h4>Employer Needs</h4>\n<ul> <li>Present themselves—in particular, small business with limited HR capacities—through a profile that contains standardized information, as well as information about the organization.</li> <li>Post specific available opportunities in a manner that is designed to address service member and veteran-specific priorities, including:&nbsp; position descriptions, required skillsets, benefits, and work environment (e.g., support for Veterans, training, onboarding, mentorship opportunities). This could include options to connect a job-seeker directly to veterans currently employed at the company.</li> <li>Generate “match lists” of qualified candidates.</li> <li>Provide technology-enabled solutions to allow for direct outreach to candidates through mechanisms they regularly check (existing email accounts, text messages) rather than a separate message management system that requires additional login (only if candidates have set their profiles to allow for direct contact).</li> </ul>\n<h4>Federal Government Needs</h4>\n<ul> <li>Access to a feedback loop to learn more about matches made, types of users, most useful feature, and other raw data to inform Federal program efforts and ultimately track outcomes, including employment that is initiated beyond 180 days, wage rates, and/or retention statistics.</li> <li>Ability to fold in/link to existing government data efforts when they reach maturity.</li> </ul>\n",

New dates for the judging period and winners announcement are also reflected under \"Dates\" in this section.</p>\n<h3><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the 5th “$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>\n<p>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA scientific research entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p>\n<h3><strong>Subject of the Challenge</strong></h3>\n<p>NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its dependable success and popularity within the community from 2016 to 2019. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas that would further an understanding of SUD and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful startups. NIDA offers $100,000 together with the technical expertise and mentoring from scientific research entrepreneurship experts and expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide the prize money and scientific research-based entrepreneurial assistance to the “would be” startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g. small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that, eventually, the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p>\n<p>What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adjusted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating the startup around their research idea. The research “idea” is the product that the future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to an underserved customer.</p>\n<p>The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation, within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.</p>\n<h3><strong>Dates</strong></h3>\n<ul> <li>The Challenge begins January 2, 2020.</li> <li>Submission Period:&nbsp; 9 a.m. ET, January 21, 2020 to May 26, 2020, 5:00 p.m. ET.</li> <li>Judging Period:&nbsp; May 27, 2020 to June 15, 2020.</li> <li>Winners Announced:&nbsp; June 22, 2020.</li> </ul>\n<h4><strong>For further information, contact:</strong></h4>\n<p>Elena Koustova, PhD, MBA, Director, Office of Translational Initiatives and Program Innovations (OTIPI), NIDA Challenge Manager, National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), 6001 Executive Blvd Room 4206, MSC 9555 Bethesda, MD 20892-9555.

The score for each submission will be the sum of the scores from each of the voting judges. The scores will be listed in order, from highest to lowest. Participants with sufficiently high scores will then be contacted for “live” meetings via the tele- or video-conference. Those meetings will be used to gather more details about the information provided in the Submission Package and to determine the up-to-date level of participant availability, interest and commitment. Final prize recommendations will be determined based on the judges’ scoring and tele- or video-conference meetings.</p>\n",

To support these programs, CAMD collects Power Sector Emissions Data, a robust dataset of emissions and operations information from over 4,000 electricity generating units (available online at <a href=\"https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/\">https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/</a>), such as:</p>\n<ul> <li>Emissions of SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>X</sub>, mercury, and CO<sub>2</sub></li> <li>Operating parameters, like heat input and gross electricity output</li> <li>Facility attributes, like location, fuel types, monitoring systems, and air pollution controls</li> </ul>\n<p>Additionally, in cooperation with the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and many other partners, CAMD also operates the Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET) monitoring program to assess long-term trends in air quality and deposition used to provide accountability for EPA&rsquo;s emission reduction programs. CASTNET provides weekly gaseous (SO<sub>2</sub>, HNO<sub>3</sub>) and particulate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>) concentrations at more than 90 sites (available online at <a href=\"https://epa.gov/castnet\">https://epa.gov/castnet</a>). Hourly concentrations of ground-level O<sub>3</sub> are also provided at most monitoring sites to support the National Ambient Air Quality Standards and assess regional and international transport of emissions.</p>\n<p>CAMD is looking to academic and research institutions to propose practical and replicable projects that benefit academic institutions, the environment, and the public. We will be looking for proposals for innovative and creative uses of CAMD data that should advance the knowledge, use, and understanding of CAMD data and related information, with priority on the following key project themes:</p>\n<ul> <li><u>Analyzing data</u>:&nbsp; Answer timely and relevant research questions using CAMD data</li> <li><u>Enhancing communications</u>:&nbsp; Design new and innovative ways to present CAMD data to the public</li> <li><u>Developing technology and data mashups</u>:&nbsp; Develop new technologies or analytic methods to integrate CAMD data with other datasets to unlock the broader potential of CAMD data</li> <li><u>Promoting environmental education</u>:&nbsp; Explore opportunities to use CAMD data in high school or university classrooms</li> <li><u>Improving data quality</u>:&nbsp; Identify and apply algorithms (e.g., machine learning) to electronically audit CAMD data and enhance data quality</li> </ul>\n",

For applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, phase 2 consists of a medical chart review.  Phase 1 of the verification of hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data is estimated to take 1 hours.  In addition, background checks will be conducted by an independent source for individual or small practice applicants to ensure there are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred (as outlined in the Eligibility section).  For large providers or health systems, their background check policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance with the individual background check protocol.  In addition, a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission’s sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., investigations for professional medical misconduct). </p>\n\n<p>Phase 2 of the validation, for applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, consists of hypertension control validation via medical chart review. </p>\n\n<p>Applicants must provide documents showing the criteria used to include patients as “controlled” and a list with each hypertensive patient found to have blood pressure in control.

The reporting year (continuous 12 months) should reflect the most currently available data.</li>\n  <li>The percent of the applicant’s adult patient population identified above that were seen during the reporting year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence). There are an estimated 14 million people who are unaware of their hypertension. Most of these people are hiding in plain sight—they are in clinical treatment with elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension neither diagnosed nor treated. Applicants selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension prevalence (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the condition) assessed for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence. Initially, a rough estimate of the applicant’s predicted hypertension prevalence will be calculated using the reported age distribution of their patient population and hypertension prevalence findings from national studies, using the <a href=\"http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/files/MH_HTN_Estimator.xlsm\">Million Hearts<sup>®</sup> Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool [Excel-88K]</a>.

If the reported hypertension prevalence is extreme and there is not a justifiable reason, the applicant may be excluded from further participation in the Challenge.</li>\n  <li>The hypertension control rate should be for the provider’s or health system’s entire adult hypertensive population identified above during the reporting year. The provider’s or health system’s hypertensive population ages 18-85 should include only patients in primary care or in cardiology care in the case of a cardiology clinic. Patients seen only in dental care or behavioral health care should not be included. Examples of ineligible data submissions include hypertension control rates that are limited to treatment cohorts from research studies or pilot studies, patients limited to a specific age range (such as 18-35), or patients enrolled in limited scale quality improvement projects.  </li>\n  <li>In addition, the hypertension control rate during the previous reporting year is also required.

The result of the First Responder UAS Endurance Challenge will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep a UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders on the ground while they conduct their mission. The advancement of UAS research achieved through this challenge will help support the development and operation of UAS that are intended to host critical tools for public safety missions, such as wireless communications systems.</p>\n\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is hosting a 4-stage challenge, with prize awards <strong>up to $588,000</strong> for the top designs. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.

PSCR’s Open Innovation team engages public safety entities, government, academia, and industry to identify innovation opportunities and foster technology advancements for public safety communications through prize competitions and challenges.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"project-objectives\">Project Objectives</h4>\n\n<p>The purpose of this Challenge is to advance UAS technologies by building and flying drones designed to support first responders. One of the barriers for the public safety community is having access to drones that can fly for long periods of time, ninety minutes or greater, while carrying a heavy payload. Emergency responders can accomplish their mission more efficiently and effectively if the drone flight time for a known payload is maximized. Since the payload capacity, energy source, flight characteristics, and flight time are linked together through design trade-offs, PSCR is exploring ways to optimize drones for increased flight endurance while making it more efficient and flexible for use by public safety.</p>\n\n<p>In pursuit of that goal, PSCR is investigating options to enable state and local first responders the ability to deploy drones for law enforcement, firefighting, and other emergency services needing broadband connectivity and services. In a typical search-and-rescue scenario, a team of one or two first responders may be dispatched to a location where broadband LTE communications are unavailable. To maintain communications, first responders might deploy an LTE system using a drone to provide communications to first responders on the ground and extend coverage to an area that is remote from where the drone initially launched. Some key features and capabilities of interest to public safety include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The drone and supporting system equipment can be stored in the cargo space of an SUV or pickup truck.</li>\n  <li>The drone should be light in weight (one-person setup), easy to set up, capable of Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) and not require special tools.</li>\n  <li>The drone may be required to move between different locations in order to maintain communications coverage.</li>\n  <li>The drone needs to continuously fly as long as possible, be easily recovered, stored and readied for the next mission.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>PSCR is aware that various organizations have, or are developing, drones with higher payload capacities and long endurance; however, these drones typically cost more than what a local public safety department might be able to afford. Additionally, they may not be practical due to the difficulty of transporting large equipment and/or the need for specialized training to operate it, both of which can be difficult for city/state agencies with limited staff and resources. Therefore, PSCR is hosting this 4-stage challenge to design, develop, and demonstrate drones with extended flight time and other capabilities that support first responders to help advance the research and push the boundaries of UAS technology for public safety.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"deliverables-due\">Deliverables Due</h4>\n\n<p>Participants will be asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a concept paper using an online form, outlining the UAS knowledge, skills, capabilities and design approach for this challenge</li>\n  <li>Create or purchase hardware necessary to build a prototype and implement the design approach outlined within the concept paper</li>\n  <li>Produce a Test flight video demonstrating the UAS prototype capabilities and safety compliance</li>\n  <li>Participate in a Virtual Competition, conducting flights at Contestant’s designated flight location and submitting videos of flights and static tests</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"uas-challenge-stages\">UAS Challenge Stages</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"blob:https://www.challenge.gov/000834eb-628d-4001-98c7-aed9e090fdd5\" alt=\"Challenge Stages\" title=\"UAS Challenge Stages\" /></p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is inviting novel Solutions for the NHLBI Big Data Analysis Challenge:&nbsp; Creating New Paradigms for Heart Failure Research. The goal of the challenge is to foster innovation in computational analysis and machine learning approaches utilizing large-scale NHLBI-funded datasets to identify new paradigms in heart failure research. The challenge aims to address the need for new open source disease models that can define sub-categorizations of adult heart failure to serve as a springboard for new research hypotheses and tool development in areas of heart failure research from basic to clinical settings.</p>\n<p>Adult heart failure is a chronic, progressive disorder in which the heart is unable to efficiently pump blood, and more than 6.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. It is currently often categorized by a single metric – left ventricular ejection fraction – but is known to be a multi-organ, systemic syndrome with many related but seemingly disparate phenotypes. Additionally, social, behavioral, environmental, and genetic determinants often captured in study data have a considerable influence on outcome but are not well-understood. The field of heart failure research currently lacks a systematic framework that incorporates these many factors in a comprehensive disease model. An adult heart failure sub-phenotyping scheme incorporating many disease-associated factors would provide a new paradigm that will benefit investigations into the mechanism of disease, diagnosis, and, ultimately, prevention and treatment.</p>\n<p>The NHLBI seeks to foster such paradigm shifts in heart failure research by awarding innovative Solutions that utilize existing large health datasets. NHLBI has a history of making considerable investments in the creation of deep data resources including:&nbsp; long-standing, deeply-phenotyped <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/population-and-epidemiology-studies\" target=\"_blank\">epidemiological cohorts</a>, innovative <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/clinical-trials/nhlbi-clinical-trials\" target=\"_blank\">clinical trials</a>, and large-scale <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/precision-medicine-activities\" target=\"_blank\">precision medicine</a> efforts that have generated whole genome sequencing and “other omics” data for more than one-hundred thousand individuals. Many of these and other data are publicly accessible via the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/\" target=\"_blank\">dbGaP</a>) and the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (<a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/\" target=\"_blank\">BioLINCC</a>). The NHLBI Heart Failure Big Data Analysis Challenge webpage, <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge</a>, provides further details about available open- and controlled-access NHLBI-funded datasets and data access resources.</p>\n<p>With these datasets in hand, the NHLBI is seeking to promote the application of computational analysis and machine learning approaches to create opportunities for hypothesis generation and research tool development for heart failure research. This challenge aims to reward innovative, computational Solutions utilizing large health datasets to develop a schema for the sub-phenotyping of adult heart failure that facilitates basic and/or clinical heart failure research objectives. A successful adult heart failure sub-phenotyping Solution will be a novel, pragmatic, accessible research tool for a spectrum of heart failure researchers. Successful Solutions will also be free and openly available to the research community. Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of NHLBI-funded datasets in the development of their Solution and are also welcome to bring other relevant data to their analyses.</p>\n",

A maximum two-day on-site support by the submitting organization may be required to optimize the configuration. At the conclusion of the Installation and Configuration stage, the technology configuration will be locked.</li> <li><strong>Training &amp; Tuning:</strong> The generation of ambient data for ML model training will happen once the range configuration is locked. Each technology will be exposed to approximately three weeks of traffic for ML model generation.</li> <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The actual test evaluation process of the tool will involve levying multiple adversarial campaigns against the enterprise, with increasing complexity and realism. Technologies will be evaluated on their ability to detect elements of each campaign as it progresses. Resource information (CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, network I/O) associated with the operation of the technology will be collected during each test within the evaluation.</li> </ol>\n<p><strong>Scoring</strong></p>\n<p>This challenge seeks to test how much of an adversarial campaign (sequence of events towards an exploitative goal) the candidate technologies can uncover. The score will be in terms of a cost estimate that simulates the cost to an enterprise using this technology for a given period of time. The cost estimate will sum simulated attack costs, labor costs, and resource costs.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Simulated attack cost:</strong>&nbsp;Estimated costs resulting from each campaign&rsquo;s malicious events will be a function representing attack costs over time. This simulates costs of lost or corrupted data, ransoms, etc. The attack cost function is increasing in time and in steps of the attack kill chain, such that early detection will accrue less cost than later (or no) detection.

            "description": "<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n\n<p>At an unprecedented pace, Federal and state leaders, community based organizations, and all avenues of the health care system are expending their time and resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We at ACL recognize the need and are expanding the timeline of this new funding opportunity. The Challenge Competition will now begin in July. As a result of this crises, there is a greater need for enhanced, standardized data tracking and referral processes and an even more need to connect people with the right community resources and supports. This will continue to be a priority as we think about the resources necessary to address the effects of COVID-19.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"todays-landscape-of-health-and-social-care-coordination-for-older-adults-and-people-with-disabilities\"><strong>Today’s Landscape of Health and Social Care Coordination for Older Adults and People with Disabilities:</strong></h4>\n\n<p>Individual health plans and health systems are implementing technology approaches to screen and refer individuals to community resources in order to address their social needs and improve their health and overall well-being. However, the existing technology solutions lack interoperability and scalability within and across communities. Since 2003, states and community based organizations (CBOs) have invested in robust resource directory and referral platforms through state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/\">No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a> integration to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. Community Based Organizations may include Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resources Centers, Centers for Independent Living or other aging and disability network agencies. State NWD Systems include a community based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state. However, provider and plan specific referral platforms are often not leveraging this existing infrastructure that enables access to a variety of services and supports that address social needs.</p>\n\n<p>While some states have developed or are planning statewide technology platforms that enable social  risk assessments and referrals from health care to community resources, there is a need for a more collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach that ensures the interoperability and scalability of such platforms. Examples of statewide approaches include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Oregon Health Leadership Council, HIT Commons: <a href=\"http://www.orhealthleadershipcouncil.org/hit-commons/\">http://www.orhealthleadershipcouncil.org/hit-commons/</a>,</li>\n  <li>Pennsylvania Request for Information for Statewide Resource and Referral Tool: <a href=\"http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=Resource%20and%20Referral%20Tool\">http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=Resource%20and%20Referral%20Tool</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As is, there is duplicative spending across stakeholders as they independently contract for different referral vendors to secure community connections. As a result, community based organizations are faced with the burden of accessing multiple platforms to receive and act on referrals. Opportunities to manage populations across a continuum of care are also limited when individuals seek care from providers with differing platforms that lack seamless connections to critical health and social care.</p>\n\n<p>The need for seamless exchange of referrals is also met with optimizing data on social determinants of health (SDoH) to ensure individuals get timely access to services and supports they need such as housing, nutrition, and transportation. Over the last several years, a variety of community led efforts are developing <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/advancing-interoperable-social-determinants-of-health-data\">industry-wide standards</a> to represent these components of SDoH and to enable exchange of person-centered data between health information technology platforms and CBOs. One such effort, perhaps the largest such activity in the SDoH space, is the <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/gravity/\">Gravity Project</a>. The Gravity Project aims to standardize medical codes and exchange standards to facilitate the use of SDoH-related data across a wide range of care management settings between health care and human services providers, and others as authorized and appropriate. There is a need for health plans and systems to require and for technology vendors to uniformly adopt technical standards, which are being developed and tested. This include standards on the format, content and structure of SDoH data, community resource directories, and bi-directional exchange of referral messages.  The mid-to-long term goal is consistent implementation of standards for SDoH data, bi-directional exchange of referrals, and resource directories across technology platforms that serve health care and CBOs.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge:</h4>\n\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for state and community leaders in the aging and disability network, health care systems, health plans, and health IT vendors to cultivate care coordination by developing and/or optimizing interoperable and scalable technology platforms. Participants are challenged with working collaboratively on enhancing scalable approaches to securely sharing standardized data on social determinants and person-centered plans through the use of open resource directories that seamlessly connect and interoperate with health care system’s electronic health records to community based organizations. This Challenge includes developing prototypes and implementing technical solutions that track referral patterns and gaps in service that visibly display social service and health related outcomes overtime.</p>\n\n<p>To demonstrate value and achieve seamless network integration technical solutions are challenged with incorporating closed-loop referral and follow-up protocols to track and support individuals when they obtain services from any organization or health care provider within the network. Producing data on the individual, organizational, and regional levels about referrals, the prevalence of SDoH, and service utilization and outcomes guarantees opportunities to strengthen coordinated referral networks across CBOs, states, and the health care system. Technology-based platforms that enable linkages between healthcare providers and the existing ecosystem of community-based, social service organizations are challenged to more efficiently share standardized data to support referral processes and better informed decision-making, ensuring that individuals are seamlessly connected to resources that address their preferences, goals, values, and social determinants in ways that promote independence in the community for as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this Challenge should include a team of key stakeholders. Strong preference will be given to teams that include state leaders across aging, disability and Medicaid programs (or their designees), community based organizations in the aging and disability networks, health IT developers, health care providers, health plans, and others with expertise in technical standards, interoperability and data analysis.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will compete in three phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $500,000.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 1: Concept &amp; Design Submission (July - December 2020)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Form multi-stakeholder team and develop idea and concept designs that include functional enhancements, open standards, and technical specifications for enhancing health and social care integration.</li>\n  <li><strong>Registration and Phase 1 Application submissions due Wednesday, January 6, 2021. See below for more information.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Phase 2: Proof of Concept &amp; Demonstration (January 2021 - June 2021)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Participant teams will convene in-person or virtually to demo proposed solutions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Phase 3: Implementation &amp; Testing - (July - December 2021)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Implementation and real-world testing of designed approach.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"what-is-a-challenge\">What is a Challenge?</h4>\n\n<p>A challenge (also referred to as “prize challenge”, “competition,” “prize competition,” “incentive prize” or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li>\n  <li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li>\n  <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of. The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p>\n\n<p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li>\n  <li>Reach wide communities of experts</li>\n  <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li>\n  <li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li>\n  <li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information, please visit: https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/</p>\n",

Solutions must be designed to assist first responders in four (4) emergency scenarios: wildfires, floods, active shooter situations, and tunnel collapses. These interfaces will improve decision-making and resource deployment capabilities for public safety personnel, ensuring America’s first responders have the tools to effectively save lives.</p>\n\n<p>AR contestants are challenged to concept and design augmented reality interfaces for two public safety users: Incident Command Officers and boots-on-the-ground First Responders. IoT contestants will emulate accurate smart city and public safety personal area network data by first determining which sensors that would be most useful for first responders and then creating data transmitters of the sensor data based on the provided emergency scenarios. The top selected data streams, developed by IoT contestants, will serve as a core data infrastructure for high performing AR contestants at a live evaluation at a public safety training center.</p>\n\n<p>Both contests consist of four (4) phases:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/chariot-table.png\" alt=\"Phase Descriptions\" title=\"Phase Descriptions\" /></p>\n",

One disease must be sickle cell, malaria, and / or anemia. Proposals will only be accepted if they describe a way to extend to two diseases on a single platform. Full points require in vivo target accuracy in representative background populations for two diseases, though scoring will be scaled appropriately.</li> <li><strong>Analytic performance. </strong>Proposed device must be relevant for clinical decision-making, with results that are comparable to or improve upon standard practice at a peripheral care setting. The device must have comparable analytic sensitivity and specificity to existing tests. The device should be able to incorporate dynamic personal and population priors (e.g. medical history or disease prevalence, respectively) to improve the accuracy of the test result in clinical settings.</li> <ul> <li>For anemia, in comparison to the reference method, 85% of the results must fall within +1.0g Hb/dL of the reference across a range of Hb concentrations spanning the healthy range and moderate to severe anemia.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Clinical utility. </strong>Device must be able to differentiate between relevant strains of the disease, across necessary population age brackets, and over the course of disease progression.</li> <ul> <li>For <strong>sickle cell</strong>, the device needs to differentiate sickle cell as early in life as possible, in conjunction with dynamic priors. Ideally, the device should be able to perform with high levels of fetal hemoglobin still present and should be able to differentiate sickle cell disease from sickle cell trait.</li> <li>For <strong>malaria</strong>, the device needs to be able to detect and differentiate various parasite species. Required are Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and / or Plasmodium vivax (Pv); Optimal is all Plasmodium species. If all species cannot be differentiated, differentiation between Pf  and Pv is desired.</li> <li>An <strong>anemia</strong> diagnostic must clinically differentiate mild, moderate and severe anemia. In addition, it must have 95% sensitivity and 90% specificity in each trimester of pregnancy at the moderate anemia threshold of 11.0g/dL and the severe anemia threshold point of 7.0g/dL.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Detection and interpretation. </strong>Proposed device should measure parameters that could be used to track disease state and/or response to therapy. Results from a test must be interpretable by a machine.</li> <li><strong>Safety. </strong>If used, light sources should be Class 2 or Class 3R with appropriate controls to avoid eye exposure or skin damage. Devices must not trigger crises or significant occlusion events in sickle cell patients. Intended use, for evaluation of feasibility data (where possible) and use case proposal:</li> <li><strong>Time to results. </strong>Results should be interpretable within 15 minutes.</li> <li><strong>Data capture. </strong>Information should be captured digitally from the device in &lt;10 seconds if handheld, and &lt;60 seconds if wearable. Data should be transferrable to a data system subsequently.</li> <li><strong>Components. </strong>The platform should be either (1) a standalone mobile device or (2) an algorithm on or small attachment to a mobile phone. Proposals should discuss potential for miniaturization of a prototype to this end state.</li> <li><strong>Form factor. </strong>The device should be self-contained and highly portable. For example, the devices should not require biological reagents, and a health worker should be able to carry it independently over varied terrain. The participants can determine the appropriate form factor for the intended use case.</li> <li><strong>Cost. </strong>The final cost of the device should be &lt;$500, not including the cost of the phone. Proposals should discuss the potential for cost-reduction to meet this target cost.</li> <li><strong>Target use case. </strong>The device should be intended for use in zero infrastructure conditions including outdoor settings and performed by untrained lay persons.</li> <li><strong>Lifespan of device. </strong>The final device should last at least two years. Proposal should discuss potential to achieve a two-year lifespan.</li> <li><strong>Ease of use. </strong>The device should have no user-timed steps; five or fewer user steps, instructions should include diagram of method and results interpretation</li> </ul>\n",

As an NSF initiative with a mission to enhance U.S. leadership in STEM by facilitating partnerships, NSF INCLUDES is sponsoring to the NSF STEM DIVE Challenge.</p>\n\n<p>NSF invites grantees from all NSF programs to showcase, in the form of a short video (1 to 3 minutes), how forging partnerships, networks, or alliances has contributed to an increase in diversity and inclusion in STEM. All entries must be submitted by a Principal Investigator (PI) or Co-PI on any previous or current funded NSF award. These videos will be used by NSF and its programs in various platforms (e.g. websites, fair exhibitions, printed materials) to exhibit how grantees have encouraged and supported diversity and inclusion in STEM preK-12, higher, and informal education. This challenge is also designed to attract more broader interest in STEM and to inform the greater community on best practices for increasing diversity and inclusion, effective partnership and networking strategies, and dissemination approaches for growing the STEM workforce.</p>\n\n<p>Entrants must be a PI or Co-PI of a current or expired National Science Foundation (NSF) grant or cooperative agreement:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>May be an individual or a team of up to four people.</li>\n  <li>Must be a U.S. citizens or permanent residents, or legal residents in the U.S. by June 24, 2020</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Employment requirements can be located at <em><a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp\">www.nsf.gov/ehr/stemdive.jsp</a></em></p>\n\n<p>Cash prizes will be issued to the registered team leader. It is the team and team leader’s responsibility to determine whether and how prizes will be shared among team members and to implement such sharing arrangements.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to cash prizes, winning videos will be posted on NSF’s Education Human Resources Directorate web page and the NSF INCLUDES National Network on <a href=\"https://www.includesnetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.includesnetwork.​org</a>.

            "description": "<p>To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking interactive prototypes for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.</p>\n\n<p>The Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"new-submission-form-and-frequently-asked-questions\"><strong>NEW! <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-appl.pdf\">Submission Form</a> and <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/redesign-faqs.pdf\">Frequently Asked Questions</a></strong></h4>\n\n<p><em>About the Department of Education</em></p>\n\n<p>ED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED’s mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access.</p>\n\n<p>Although ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation’s schools. However, due to concern that ED would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868.</p>\n\n<p>Over the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services).</p>\n\n<p><em>The Current State of ED.gov</em></p>\n\n<p>To achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90 percent of American adults reporting using the internet “<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/276445/number-of-internet-users-in-the-united-states/\">at least occasionally</a>”  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that effort is redesigning ED’s website.</p>\n\n<p>ED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials; non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.</p>\n\n<p>The Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov, www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS) and is hosted externally in a cloud environment.</p>\n\n<p><em>Limitations and Challenges of Current Design</em></p>\n\n<p>Nearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is <a href=\"https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf\">unattractive</a>, and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing <a href=\"https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/20-web-design-facts-small-business-owners/\">credibility</a>. Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages with, the content on ED.gov.</p>\n\n<p>The last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content layouts using responsive design.</p>\n\n<p>While the update included several important changes, the design fell short in key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that meets their needs. The current site:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Remains difficult to navigate;</li>\n  <li>Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user experience;</li>\n  <li>Relies too heavily on text;</li>\n  <li>Is antiquated; and</li>\n  <li>Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov</em></p>\n\n<p>The goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design, navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The challenge is for design prototypes only.</strong> The design prototypes received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still, applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more details below).</p>\n\n<p>ED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should focus on that foundation.  In the improved design, ED.gov should have:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Accessible content for desktop, mobile, and tablet users;</li>\n  <li>Integrated social media, RSS feeds, and subscription services;</li>\n  <li>Elegant, clean, simple, user-centered look and feel with a modern aesthetic;</li>\n  <li>Strong ED branding on the homepage, and throughout the entire site with a consistent appearance;</li>\n  <li>New and innovative tools that enhance user experience; and</li>\n  <li>Engaging and easy-to-navigate pages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Performance Objectives</em></p>\n\n<p>The redesign of ED.gov should engage the American public, amplify the Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high availability and high performance.</p>\n\n<p>Innovators should ensure to the greatest extent practicable that any design supports the federally mandated <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ336/PLAW-115publ336.pdf\">21st Century Idea Act</a> for modernization, including complying with the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Be accessible to individuals with disabilities by applying section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</li>\n  <li>Uses the <a href=\"https://designsystem.digital.gov/\">US Web Design System</a> maturity model to create and implement the site.</li>\n  <li>Have a consistent appearance.</li>\n  <li>Contain a search function intended for public use.</li>\n  <li>Be provided through an industry-standard, secure connection.</li>\n  <li>Be fully functional and usable on common mobile devices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Key Parameters</em></p>\n\n<p>In redesigning ED.gov, Challenge participants should focus on six (6) key templates:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Homepage (<a href=\"http://www.ed.gov\">http://www.ed.gov</a>);</li>\n  <li>Program office page (<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc\">https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc</a>)</li>\n  <li>Informational page (<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn\">https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn</a>);</li>\n  <li>Grant page (<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html\">https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html</a>);</li>\n  <li>Contact page (<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft\">https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft</a>); and</li>\n  <li>News page (<a href=\"http://www.ed.gov/news\">http://www.ed.gov/news</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The prototype must also comply with the following directives:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>New designs should conform with ED’s existing color scheme and use its current seal.</li>\n  <li>New designs must not use proprietary software or operating systems unless necessary.</li>\n  <li>The site should use either the Drupal and/or WordPress open-source CMS for web or content creation and for managing information or content on a webpage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Prototypes may incorporate text and content already available on the website, or dummy text.</p>\n\n<p><em>Deliverables</em></p>\n\n<p>To meet the need of this challenge, participants should provide a link to an interactive prototype of an ED.gov redesign for the above six pages.  In addition, participants should provide back-up documentation for the prototype that includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Wireframes that present the site layout and navigation.</li>\n  <li>Mock-ups that include the layout and navigation from the wireframes but with brand and site colors, logo, images, content blocks, typography, etc.</li>\n  <li>Other information such as open-source CMS used, development language(s), browser(s) supported, mobile compatibility, screen resolutions (including responsive for mobile), operating systems, assistive technologies, text sizing, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Invited participant names are listed below in alphabetical order:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>ADA Technologies, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Americase, LLC</li>\n  <li>Cornerstone Research Group, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Energy Storage Safety Products International, LLC</li>\n  <li>Fire Containment Concepts</li>\n  <li>KULR Technology Corp.</li>\n  <li>Mistral, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Proycon Alpha Squared, Inc.</li>\n  <li>Purdue University</li>\n  <li>Scimitar Technologies</li>\n  <li>StatDiagnostics</li>\n  <li>Texas Research Institute - Austin</li>\n  <li>ViPER (Purdue University)</li>\n  <li>Zarges Inc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lithium batteries’ benefits of increased capabilities at a reduced weight outweigh their inherent risks in many industrial, commercial and some military applications. However, these benefits do not outweigh the inherent risk of transporting the batteries. For example, most commercial passenger airlines do not allow lithium batteries to be packed inside checked luggage due to the inherent fire hazard in a cargo hold, which represents an unacceptable risk. Likewise, military (and other users) transportation of lithium batteries represents risks that are also sometimes unacceptable. A solution that develops a containment system to carry batteries that suitably mitigates the inherent hazards is desired to allow more applications, commercial and military, to benefit from the use of rechargeable (called “secondary”) and non-rechargeable (called “primary”) lithium batteries.</p>\n\n<p>The objective for this Lithium Battery Man Portable Containment Challenge is to demonstrate a method to transport military-qualified lithium primary and secondary batteries that mitigates hazards generated during a thermal runaway event. Since some lithium batteries are more reactive than other types, a proposed solution does not have to accommodate all types of current military lithium batteries, but a solution that does accommodate more lithium battery types is more valuable for the purposes of this challenge. Man portable can be defined as a single person carry up to 50 Lbs, which will include up to 12.5 Lbs of batteries. The challenge assumes no battery charging or discharging will occur during transportation of lithium batteries.</p>\n\n<p>Additional threshold parameters include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Contain or extinguish all fire and large (greater than 5 micrometers diameter) particulates generated during a thermal runaway event</li>\n  <li>Limit and neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released gases from the container</li>\n  <li>Be stackable with secure attachment points for carrying straps, handles, tie-down</li>\n  <li>Securely immobilize the contained batteries</li>\n  <li>Provide a degree of shock and vibration isolation for the batteries contained</li>\n  <li>Provide a degree of water and moisture protection for the batteries contained</li>\n  <li>Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in circumference and 11.5” in radius</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additional stretch objectives parameters include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Be capable of containing all vent gases</li>\n  <li>Be capable of reducing the hazards of released toxic vent gases</li>\n  <li>Ability to convey externally that a hazardous event has occurred inside the container</li>\n  <li>Ability to suppress or extinguish the thermal runaway event internal to the container</li>\n  <li>Reduction in physical dimension and/or weight to improve portability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The challenge will be completed via a four Phased approach. Phase I objective is to provide a concept “white paper” from which a Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept may be invited. Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate a limited Proof-of-Concept (POC). Phase III objective is to fabricate and demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. Phase IV will include any potential follow-on award(s). The Government may, at its discretion, award follow-on(s) for the continuous development of the technology development. The Government does not currently have funding for follow-on award(s).</p>\n\n<p>Detailed solution is defined as a technical illustration or Computer aided Design (CAD) model of the proposed solution with consideration to threshold parameters. POC is defined as a small project created to test whether a certain idea or theory about the product can be implemented. Technology Development Prototype is defined as a product that is capable to be tested to successfully demonstrate the ability to meet the challenge objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Phase I objective is to “virtually” (e.g. via a phone or video conference) present your concept. Phase I will be conducted in two phases: Initial submission of White Paper Concept followed by an invitation to provide a Virtual Presentation of White Paper Concept. The White Paper Concept shall describe in detail the Challenge objectives your solution will address, how your proposed solution would achieve those objectives, how if selected for Phase II you intend to design your solution, what POC will be developed and evaluated and describe your plans for how you would intend for your solution to be manufactured and sold.</p>\n\n<p>The Government will select up to fifteen (15) White Paper Concepts for invitation for a Virtual Presentation of their proposed concept to a panel of judges. The Virtual Presentation shall provide a summary of the white paper contents and include detail on how you intend to accomplish phase II objectives, provide a notional schedule, and a list of any concerns, clarifications or other questions you have regarding resources or information you need technical assistance with to accomplish the challenge. Up to five (5) winners will be selected to participate in Phase II.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II objective is to design a detailed solution and demonstrate any Proof-of-Concept (POC) needed to provide confidence in the design. Results from the detailed design and POC testing will be provided to the Government team via another Virtual Presentation. Presentation should also include data supporting effectiveness of design along with identification of what design attributes will be considered vendor versus government purpose rights. Up to three (3) winners will be selected to participate in Phase III.</p>\n\n<p>Phase III objective is to demonstrate a Technology Development Prototype. The Technology Development Prototype will be required to demonstrate the capability of withstanding the thermal runaway event of four lithium-ion military BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar ~300 Wh Li-ion batteries. A single center-located battery should be triggered artificially by means of thermal abuse (e.g. via heat tape or some other suitable method). The technology development prototype should demonstrate the capability at ambient temperature to contain the thermal event without releasing flame, sparks or large particles while maintaining a surface temperature that would not trigger the combustion of adjacent materials. The container should also limit and preferably neutralize (reduce combustibility and/or toxicity) all released gases. Note that this type of testing is inherently hazardous, and Government personnel will consult with you on the safe execution of this POC in advance. All three winners may be selected to participate in Phase IV.</p>\n\n<p>Phase IV the Government may choose to award follow-on FAR-based procurement contract, an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award (under 10 U.S.C. 2371 or 2371b), a procurement contract for experimental purposes (10 U.S.C 2373), or a combination of awards under those authorities to any chosen participant in this prize challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Initial submission of the White Paper Concept shall not exceed five pages and required to be in the following format.</p>\n\n<p>a. Text size shall be no smaller than what is equivalent to Microsoft Word, Times New Roman, 10 point, uncompressed font.</p>\n\n<p>b.

This effort, as with all Government projects, has its own set of deadlines and metrics that we must meet independent of the COVID-19 impacts. Our position is that the additional two-week extension that was given to extend the submission deadline to 07 May 2020 is sufficient for interested organizations to develop the minimalistic white paper submission required for Phase I. We do not intend at this time to provide any additional extensions to this initial phase of this challenge.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: While carefully reading the threshold parameters, we came across “Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in circumference and 11.5” in radius”. It looks like that you are assuming the cylindrical object to hold four batteries and not rectangular. However, in order to have 36” circumference, is the 11.5” is radius or diameter. If its diameter, the calculations for circumference C (36”) = 2PI r = 2x3.14x5.75 would make sense. Please clarify.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: The requirement is that one orientation of the containment system must have a maximum diameter of 23”. This containment system does not have to have a side that is round.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Please clarify the dimension requirements and in particular this: “Physical dimension must have a single side that is less than 36” in circumference and 11.5” in radius”. For a rectangular enclosure of dimensions 14.5” x 13.5” x 5.5”, how would you calculate the sides circumference and radius for such enclosure? Would it meet your requirements?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: The requirement is that one orientation of the containment system must have a maximum diameter of 23”. This containment system does not have to have a side that is round.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Are the cells used in the BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG military battery cylindrical cells (i.e. 18650 or similar dimension) ; or are they polymer flat cells?</p>\n\n<p>a. If they are cylindrical cells, how many cells comprise the battery? What is the composition of the cells and at what percentages? (i.e. Li-Cobalt, Li-Nickel, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>b. If they are polymer flat cells, how many cells comprise the battery? What is the composition of the cells and at what percentages?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><em>Answer: The BB-2590 batteries use the cylindrical format 18650 Li-ion cells configured as two series sets, each with 3 parallel strings of 4 cells in series, for 24 cells total in each BB-2590.</em></p>\n\n    <p><em>a. For the answers, you may refer to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) provided by the BB-2590 manufacturer for details on chemistry and composition of the cells used in the battery. As for cell count, you can obtain the number of cells based on the cell chemistry characteristics, case dimensions, battery overall capacity and voltage.</em></p>\n\n    <p><em>b. Not applicable.</em></p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question: Can a company that is currently producing similar products and selling them modify a product to specifications set forth, or does the USN desire a prototype developed strictly for their use?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Answer: As stated in the challenge, either a BB-2590 Bren-Tronics BT-70791CG or similar approximately 300 Wh Li-ion battery may be used. If you produce a battery that can be proposed for the challenge as “similar” to the BB-2590 (meaning sufficiently close in Wh, voltage range, packaging and dimensions), that would be acceptable.

L. No 111-358), as codified in 15 U.S.C. § 3719.</p>\n\n<p>This challenge anticipates awarding prizes to challenge contestants who submit innovative approaches that address information extraction across ASAPS multimodal data streams and perform fusion in real time across extracted data to generate actionable data reports about simulated and staged emergency events. One of the most important objectives of this program is to demonstrate how data can be used to enable decision support tools and capabilities for public safety. This challenge is a nationwide innovation contest taking place throughout 2020, 2021, and 2022. The challenge is anticipated to be administered in four discrete contests. In the context of multiple contests, these are the official rules for Contest 1 only.</p>\n\n<p>Contest 1 will focus on developing innovative “plans of attack” focused on data extraction and fusion, refining and focusing the details relevant to the ASAPS Challenge’s problem statement, partnering between contestants to form highly qualified teams, and encouraging collaborative and creative thought around potential approaches to developing solutions. NIST anticipates awarding up to $150,000 in cash to winning contestants in Contest 1. In addition, contestants will be familiarized with the development data set and version 1.0 of the test harness and encouraged to provide feedback for potential updates in advance of the second contest.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Pre-registration begins: February 10, 2020</li>\n  <li>Open to submissions: April 13, 2020</li>\n  <li>Submission deadline: August 7, 2020 @ 5pm ET</li>\n  <li>Reviewing &amp; Judging: August 10 to September 14, 2020</li>\n  <li>Winners Announced: September 17, 2020</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The area of real-time automated analytics is understudied – especially with regards to the analytic fusion of multiple sources of unstructured information in real-time. The future of public safety demands automated solutions to analyze live data, provide improved situational awareness, and alert and inform decision making.</p>\n\n<p>Extracting information from video, audio and textual communications, social media, and sensors presents a significant analytic challenge. It is virtually impossible for humans to co-analyze these data streams in real-time, and, currently, there are few automated tools to analyze these types of unstructured data in real-time and virtually no automated tools to create dynamic analytic models of public safety emergencies as emergency situations\nevolve.</p>\n\n<p>With the maturation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specialized architectures and processors for AI applications, cloud computing, high-speed communications networks and streaming data resources and protocols, it is now possible to create automated tools to assist public safety organizations in analyzing the increasingly large amounts of information at their fingertips to help them make the most informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of the data available. Such tools will help distill, structure, and present\nthe quickly evolving information from a multitude of data streams to public safety organizations in a way that supports time-critical decision making and serves as an essential force multiplier.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the multitude of sensors and devices being used in public safety along with communications data collected in operations and contributed by the public, and the multi-modal nature of all of these data streams, transforming data, especially unstructured data, into information in real-time is one of the key technology gaps that must be bridged to achieve advances in this area. The available technology is insufficient to bridge this technological gap because:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Most automated data analysis tools have been developed for use with archival data and focus on post-event forensic analysis.</li>\n  <li>Few analytic technologies focus on a moving representation of live streaming data that is updated over time, and that can be used to show temporal changes in the analysis.</li>\n  <li>Tools that make data available to first responders in real-time are heavily weighted towards a visual representation of responder location and structured reporting of known emergency communications.</li>\n  <li>Few public safety emergency analysis tools exist that provide an effective real-time automated analysis and fusion of information from unstructured public safety communications streams and sensor- and citizen-generated data streams.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Note that while public safety organizations must often grapple with answering the who, what, when, and where of emergencies, the research supported by this Challenge focuses only on the what, when, and where aspects of streaming data analysis and specifically excludes identity-related technologies such as facial and voice biometrics which are considered out of scope for this research program - with the exception of technology to maintain scene-relative identification of people/vehicle/object/place entities involved in emergencies in order to associate activities with the entities they are involved with. This focus of the Challenge is because the area of identifying the situational and time-critical evolving characteristics of an emergency across information streams is under-researched. This Challenge seeks to focus research on analyzing a plethora of fast-moving data streams for\nlife/infrastructure-critical situational information to support both effective and efficient response.</p>\n\n<p>Public safety organizations are inundated with live streaming data from a variety of sources. This live streaming data generally falls into two categories - some of this data is structured, while much of it is unstructured. Structured data that resides in a fixed field within a record or file (the kind typically found in spreadsheets or relational databases) is formatted in a way so that it can be readily queried. By contrast, unstructured data (e.g., video and audio) generally does not have a pre-<em>defined data</em> model or is not organized in a pre-<em>defined</em> manner and, therefore, is not readily searchable. The lack of a defined data model prevents the data from being automatically interpreted and used by automated decision support applications without significant human intervention.</p>\n\n<p>In this first contest, NIST PSCR is inviting a novel multidisciplinary community to share its vision for how to analyze numerous live data streams, understand the data, and transform it into information to support public safety decisions. We are looking for ideas that address the following analytic tasks as well as an overall extraction to analysis systems platform approach to the contest elements. The core analytic tasks for this contest can be\nbroadly described as:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Information extraction across data streams and data sources:</strong> Structured information is continuously extracted from each of the data streams that are necessary to support downstream analysis and detection of emergency events.</li>\n  <li><strong>Information fusion across extracted data and generation of live/dynamic information representation:</strong> Joint inferencing is performed across all of the information in the extracted streams to create an event-level analysis of an emergency and store that information in a dynamically evolving structured data\nrepresentation that can be utilized at any time during the life of an emergency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Automated emergency event analysis:</strong> Highly actionable analytic reports about emergency events are generated from the extracted/fused structured information (as described in the above topics) into a form that can be readily rendered into actionable user-readable reports in real-time and in both ongoing and summary forms.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Success in this ideation contest is dependent upon a clear vision of the   components, platform, and novel approaches that fulfill the functions of real-time information extraction, live dynamic information fusion and\nrepresentation, and evolving emergency event analysis.</p>\n\n<p>Figure 1.

            "description": "<p>The mission of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s (“CFTC”) is to promote the integrity, resilience, and vibrancy of the U.S. derivatives markets through sound regulation. As part of this mission, the CFTC regulates a variety of individuals and organizations. These include futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, retail foreign exchange dealers, introducing brokers, designated contract markets, foreign boards of trade, swap dealers, and other entities and individuals. To promote market integrity, the CFTC surveils the derivatives markets for various abuses, and holds wrongdoers accountable.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, fraudsters use a variety of social engineering, fake profiling, and manipulative techniques to ensnare their victims. Fraud tactics regularly employ common keywords and phrases. With this information, there is an opportunity to utilize modern technology as a tool to augment traditional, manual efforts and to identify bad actors.</p>\n\n<p>The CFTC is vigilant to protect customers from unscrupulous fraudsters, including those operating outside the U.S. LabCFTC is launching this competition (“Project Streetlamp”) to call on innovators to utilize technology, including artificial intelligence (“AI”), and innovative approaches to detect foreign entities that should be – but are not –registered with the CFTC. The competition is intended to generate information that ultimately helps customers make more informed decisions about whether to trade with, or through, these unregistered foreign entities.</p>\n\n<p>View the Project Streetlamp <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/project-streetlamp-official-announcement.pdf\">official announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The RED List</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Registration Deficient List, or “<a href=\"https://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/Resources/Check/redlist.htm\">RED List</a>,” provides public notice that a foreign entity is engaged in conduct that requires registration with the CFTC, but has not in fact registered. Generally, foreign entities that solicit U.S. residents to trade in CFTC-regulated markets are required to register with the CFTC. Registration provides both a legal framework that includes safeguards and client protections, as well as mechanisms for recourse in the event an issue arises.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of the RED List is to provide information to U.S. customers about foreign entities that are acting in an unregistered capacity and to help them make more informed decisions about whether to trade with or through such an entity. While registration is no guarantee against fraud or mismanagement by an otherwise unscrupulous firm or individual, registration does bring a higher level of security and accountability to the trading public. Customers that trade with and through registered entities have greater protections and recourse available.</p>\n\n<p>In certain cases, a review by the CFTC reveals that certain foreign entities solicit and/or accept funds from U.S. customers, have limited or no U.S. presence, and may be acting in a capacity that requires registration, but yet are <em>not</em> registered with the CFTC. After such review, foreign entities which meet the RED List criteria are included on the RED List.</p>\n\n<p>The process to update and maintain the RED List relies on tips and referrals from concerned individuals as well as investigative work by CFTC staff. The work is time-intensive. Given the scope of global markets, range of participants, and limited resources, the process could benefit from technology applications, including those that leverage AI, which can identify and flag potentially problematic activity for further follow-up by CFTC staff. This may enable a more efficient and comprehensive search and review process to identify foreign entities for inclusion on the RED List. Also, it could enable the CFTC to be proactive in its ongoing efforts to maintain the RED List. Currently, it is only after wrongdoing is <em>reported</em> that an entity is investigated for possible enforcement action or inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"competition\">Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The goal of Project Streetlamp is to explore how AI and other technologies can help the CFTC maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date RED List by automating the process of identifying foreign entities potentially engaged in CFTC-regulated activity.  AI could be an important component of such a tool, because the technology has the potential to learn the “footprints” of actors that are unregistered, but engaged in CFTC-regulated activity. For example, key identifying data (<em>e.g.</em>, keywords, website data, audience information, network and outreach, etc.) associated with unregistered entities known to be engaged in CFTC-regulated activity could be used to develop a model that is useful for identifying other unknown entities.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will develop a tool to identify companies engaged in activity that the CFTC should investigate further for possible inclusion on the RED List. Such activity may include, but is not limited to: soliciting or accepting customers’ orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool. This information may also help identify broader trends or behavior that the CFTC finds helpful to target customer education and awareness efforts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"red-list-inclusion-criteria\">RED List Inclusion Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>The following criteria may help competition participants develop a tool that can appropriately identify foreign entities that should be included on the CFTC’s RED List.</p>\n\n<p><em>1.  Is the entity foreign?</em></p>\n\n<p>Only foreign entities are included on the RED List. For purposes of the tool, an entity is foreign if its place of business is anywhere other than the U.S. An entity may not be domestic simply because it self-identifies as having a physical presence in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p><em>2.  Does the foreign entity have any or a limited U.S. presence?</em></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of the tool, an entity that has only a limited U.S. presence may still be considered a “foreign entity” and included on the RED List. An entity will be considered to have a limited U.S. presence if its only presence is: a virtual office; a sham address; a U.S. phone number; or its website or domain hosting service. An entity that has more than a limited U.S. presence is not considered a “foreign entity,” and therefore the tool should not designate it for the RED List. For this purpose, indicia of a U.S. presence may include, among other things, whether an entity has: a U.S. agent or representative; a bank or other financial account(s) held by a financial institution in the U.S; a physical office space; or any other substantive presence in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p><em>3.  Does the foreign entity appear to solicit or accept U.S.-based residents?</em></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of the tool, an entity solicits a U.S. resident if, from a U.S.-based IP address: a U.S. resident is able to open an account with the entity; or the entity does not block a U.S. resident from opening an account.</p>\n\n<p><em>4.  Does the foreign entity offer products within the CFTC’s jurisdiction, including for example, futures, options on futures (“options”), foreign currency (“forex”), binary options, leveraged metals, contracts for difference (“CFD”), or Bitcoin derivatives (and any other virtual currency contracts regulated by the CFTC)?</em></p>\n\n<p>Where an unregistered foreign entity offers futures, options, forex, CFDs, or other derivatives subject to CFTC jurisdiction to U.S. customers the tool should consider this a positive factor for inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<p><em>5.  Is the foreign entity required to be registered with the CFTC?</em></p>\n\n<p>For purposes of the tool, conduct in connection with a CFTC jurisdictional product that requires registration with the CFTC may include, among other things: accepting customer funds; soliciting or accepting customers’ orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool.</p>\n\n<p><em>6.  Is the foreign entity currently not registered with the CFTC?</em></p>\n\n<p>The National Futures Association’s public registration database at <a href=\"https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet\">https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet</a> includes entities that are registered with the CFTC. If an entity is registered or has an exemption from registration, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<p><em>7.  In the case of binary options, is the foreign entity currently not registered as a Foreign Board of Trade (“FBOT”)?</em></p>\n\n<p>The CFTC maintains a <a href=\"https://sirt.cftc.gov/sirt/sirt.aspx?Topic=ForeignBoardsofTrade\">database of registered FBOT’s</a>. If an entity is registered as an FBOT, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"outputs\">Outputs</h4>\n\n<p>For purposes of this contest, successful tools will use AI and/or other technology to scan public sources and relevant data. To accomplish this, a tool should be able to assess foreign entities against the criteria listed above in order to generate a report that identifies foreign entities for potential inclusion on the RED List. To the extent possible, the output should include the foreign entity’s name and/or “doing business as” name, country of origin, owners/operators, and contact information (phone, email, social media, website(s), and/or address(es)), as may be available. The tool should also be able to provide a justification based on the criteria above for why any particular foreign entity has been identified.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the tool should incorporate an archive function that saves searches and results for future reference and audit purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will determine the best approach to create their tool and to deploy it, as well as the format of the report and output that is generated. The output may be in any machine readable format (<em>e.g.</em>, csv, xml, excel) to facilitate further analysis.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Reference to the NFA is for informational purposes only and does not constitute endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the U.S. government.</em></p>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>Updates have been made to the Stage II Judging Criteria section below.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For more information about the Challenge and related activities please visit <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign\">https://www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"summary\">Summary</h4>\n\n<p>An estimated <a href=\"https://www.bts.gov/travel-patterns-with-disabilities\">25.5 million Americans experience a travel-limiting disability</a> that impacts their access to employment, medical care, and other activities of daily living. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical need for vulnerable populations to have on-demand transportation services to access healthcare, pharmacies, grocery stores, and other essential services. Automated vehicles, particularly those designed to be operated exclusively by Level 4 and Level 5 Automated Driving Systems (ADS), hold great promise to enhance freedom of movement for these individuals. However, fulfilling this promise will require innovation and creativity, not only in how vehicles drive themselves, but also in how all users access and interact with them.</p>\n\n<p>Through the Inclusive Design Challenge, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks innovative, inclusive design features to enable people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities to use automated vehicles, particularly ADS-dedicated vehicles (ADS-DV) that are operated exclusively at Levels 4 and 5 (see Notes on Terminology below for additional detail on terms used throughout this Challenge). Solutions must address one or more aspects of ADS-DV use - such as locating and entering an ADS-DV or interacting with the vehicle in routine and emergency situations - through physical hardware and/or human-machine interface (HMI) designs. Individuals and teams will compete for an overall prize purse of up to $5,000,000 in a two-stage competition. In Stage I, DOT solicits brief technical proposals for inclusive design features that could then be demonstrated in prototype form by semifinalists in Stage II.</p>\n\n<p>By using a prize competition format, DOT seeks to draw attention to the topic of passenger vehicle accessibility; encourage new cross-disciplinary collaborations; incentivize the development of new approaches and technologies to improve mobility; and tap into the creativity and knowledge of the disability community, researchers, advocates, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs. DOT aims to attract ideas from around the nation to identify new solutions for common access issues.</p>\n\n<p>This Challenge seeks inclusive solutions, referring to features and designs that enable access to and use of a vehicle by people with a wide range of physical, sensory and cognitive disabilities. Technology has already changed how most of us get around. This Challenge seeks to ensure that these new technology-driven mobility options are inclusive of all Americans.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n\n<p>DOT is eager to realize the potential mobility benefits that ADS-DVs could bring to people with disabilities. ADS-DVs, could offer greater levels of mobility for individuals who either cannot drive or require a vehicle with extensive modifications, but only if their needs are considered explicitly and incorporated into future ADS-DV designs. DOT recognizes that the diversity of disabilities and resulting implications for vehicle design features makes this a complicated engineering challenge. While some mobility services (e.g., public transportation or for-hire vehicles, such as taxis) currently incorporate some accessibility features, few of these features are universally included in passenger vehicles as part of vehicle design. Meanwhile, aftermarket solutions tend to be expensive and cumbersome.</p>\n\n<p>Several recent publications are provided at <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign\">www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign</a> to offer further information on the needs, challenges, and opportunities that ADS-DVs introduce for people with disabilities.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-details\">Challenge Details</h4>\n\n<p>DOT seeks ideas for inclusive features that will enable future ADS-DVs to meet the needs of people with disabilities safely, effectively, and efficiently. Participants will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative design solutions to increase access to and use of ADS-DVs for people with disabilities. Such features can be human-machine interfaces, physical hardware designs, or combinations thereof that can allow a person with a physical, sensory, and/or cognitive disability to perform one or more tasks required to use an ADS-DV. Solutions may be proposed as standalone features or integrated into a holistic vehicle design. Successful solutions will show that they have taken into account production feasibility and an understanding of the needs and constraints of both industry and travelers with disabilities. The Department notes that it is seeking to further innovation in inclusive design for ADS-DVs with this Challenge, rather than the development of the Automated Driving Systems themselves. Thus, awards are judged solely on the factors described in this statement, and are not based on the sophistication Of any ADS included as part of a prototype vehicle. See Stage II Prototype/Demonstration below for additional details on prototype expectations and requirements.</p>\n\n<p>The sections below provide important information on elements to consider as part of your Challenge solution.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"vehicle-platform\"><em>Vehicle Platform</em></h5>\n\n<p>Participants should consider features intended to be incorporated into vehicles that can serve a wide range of communities and are capable of operating at highway speeds. Participants have flexibility in choosing a vehicle to use as a reference or base platform in developing their feature(s), keeping in mind the focus of the Challenge is developing inclusive solutions for ADS-DVs that could either function as personal vehicles or as part of a shared private fleet. Please note that the Challenge is not specifically soliciting solutions to be used exclusively in public transportation. However, successful solutions may have application to both private and public transportation.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"vehicle-use\"><em>Vehicle Use</em></h5>\n\n<p>Participants will develop inclusive design solutions to address one or more of the following tasks that an ADS-DV user with a disability will need to complete:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Locating an ADS-DV - Including, but not limited to, being notified that a vehicle has arrived; identifying the correct vehicle and locating and navigating to the correct vehicle.</li>\n  <li>Entering an ADS-DV- Including, but not limited to, unlocking and opening vehicle door(s); deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for wheelchair users or people with other physical disabilities or mobility equipment; and closing vehicle door(s).</li>\n  <li>Securing Passengers and Mobility Equipment - Including, but not limited to, securing seatbelts and other passenger restraints; securing wheelchairs or other mobility equipment to the vehicle; and accommodating service animals.</li>\n  <li>Inputting Information - Including, but not limited to, confirming passenger identity; searching for, entering, and changing a desired destination; confirming the vehicle’s destination; selecting a specific drop-off point (e.g., a particular entrance to a large complex or a location with a curb cut or sufficient space to deploy a ramp or other physical device).</li>\n  <li>Interacting with the ADS in routine and emergency situations - Including, but not limited to, operating passenger convenience and safety features (e.g., entertainment, window controls, locks, climate control); monitoring the vehicle’s location and route progress; changing the vehicle’s destination en route; requesting assistance (emergency or non-emergency); understanding and performing appropriate actions in the event of a breakdown or crash.</li>\n  <li>Exiting an ADS-DV - Including, but not limited to, being notified and confirming that a vehicle has reached its intended destination; releasing passenger and/or mobility equipment restraints; identifying and locating the safe and appropriate door(s) from which to exit the vehicle; recognizing when it is safe to exit a vehicle; opening door(s) and deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for passengers and/or mobility equipment (e.g., wheelchairs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"disability-types\"><em>Disability Types</em></h5>\n\n<p>For the Challenge, inclusiveness will be evaluated, in part, by the extent to which proposed solutions address a range of disabilities and needs. As noted above, applicants will need to demonstrate working engagement(s) with representatives from the disability community in their design process.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will also focus their efforts by designing solutions for use by one or more of the following groups:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>People with physical disabilities</li>\n  <li>People with sensory disabilities</li>\n  <li>People with cognitive disabilities</li>\n  <li>People with multiple types of disabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"production-feasibility\"><em>Production Feasibility</em></h5>\n\n<p>DOT seeks proposals through this Challenge that strike a balance between innovation and near-term implementation. For innovation to have the desired impact, implementation is critical. Participants are expected to discuss factors related to the feasibility of producing their solution(s), including the maturity of the technology underlying the inclusive design elements of the proposed design, as well as cost and other production considerations. “Production” here refers to the incorporation of the proposed solution(s) into a vehicle as original equipment, integration into an existing vehicle platform as part of an aftermarket modification, or a holistic reimagining of passenger vehicle design with a focus on seamlessly integrating inclusive features.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-structure\">Challenge Structure</h4>\n\n<h5 id=\"overall-schedule\"><em>Overall Schedule</em></h5>\n\n<p>DOT anticipates that the Challenge will proceed according to the schedule outlined below. Dates are subject to change with any changes being posted on the DOT’s Challenge website accordingly.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stage I Launch: April 21, 2020</li>\n  <li>Stage I Close: October 30, 2020, 5:00 PM Eastern</li>\n  <li>Stage I Selection/ Awards, Launch of Stage II: January 2021 (anticipated)</li>\n  <li>Stage II Design Charrette: Summer 2021 (anticipated)</li>\n  <li>Stage II Close, Prototype Demonstrations at U.S. DOT Headquarters: June 2022 (anticipated)</li>\n  <li>Stage II Prize Selections: July 2022 (anticipated)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h5 id=\"stage-i-proof-of-concept\"><em>Stage I, Proof of Concept</em></h5>\n\n<p>In Stage I, eligible Participants will submit proposals for inclusive design solutions for ADS-DVs. DOT will select up to ten semifinalists to advance to Stage II to develop a functional prototype of their idea and compete for a cash prize.</p>\n\n<p>Stage I proposals will be limited to written, descriptive summaries (no more than 10 pages; see “Stage I Submission Requirements” below for additional detail on proposal length constraints), supporting visual exhibits, and accompanying information (team biographies, etc.) as outlined below.</p>\n\n<h5 id=\"stage-ii-prototypedemonstration\"><em>Stage II, Prototype/Demonstration</em></h5>\n\n<p>In Stage II, the semifinalists selected to advance from Stage I will develop their concepts into functional prototypes of an inclusive design solution.</p>\n\n<p>A functional prototype may include one or more of the options outlined below, as appropriate given the nature of solution(s) being demonstrated, their sophistication, and the time available. DOT will not require semifinalists to demonstrate their proposed feature(s) on an actual vehicle, although a team may determine that doing so is necessary and/or advantageous to illustrate maturity, production/integration feasibility, or functionality.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Full-size physical prototype</strong>, either:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Integrated into a vehicle (the vehicle itself does not need to be automated, but should be reflective of vehicles being developed and tested with Level 4 or 5 automation).</li>\n      <li>Full-size, standalone demonstration separate from a vehicle. In this case, Participants should be prepared to illustrate how their proposed solution would be integrated into a full-size vehicle, potentially through one of the other prototype approaches listed.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Software prototype</strong> - Given that certain solutions or components of broader solutions will entail a software/interface component, Participants can consider functioning software interfaces as prototypes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Scale physical prototype</strong> - If a full-size physical prototype is infeasible for the proposed solution given the time and resources available, Participants may consider demonstrating their concept via a scale model. Accompanying demonstration exhibits may complement scale prototypes, particularly to demonstrate engineering feasibility, integration into a vehicle platform, and usability.</li>\n  <li><strong>Virtual prototype</strong> - DOT will consider the submission of virtual prototypes (3D models, computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, schematics) of physical solutions, but strongly encourages Participants to consider other primary means of demonstrating their solution(s), and to limit the use of virtual prototypes to supporting/secondary exhibits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>DOT anticipates that partway through Stage II one or more design charrettes will be held with subject matter experts from industry and the disability community. At the end of Stage II, teams will be invited to Washington, D.C. to demonstrate their prototypes. After this, the final prize selections will be announced. Up to three finalists will be selected and awarded a portion of the remaining prize purse, contingent upon review of the Stage II submissions and demonstrations against the judging criteria. As discussed below under Judging Criteria, the details of Stage II are subject to change and will not be finalized until Stage I is complete. DOT may, in its sole discretion, not proceed with Stage II.</p>\n",

In its standard J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems, SAE International refers to such vehicles as ADS-dedicated vehicles or ADS-DVs. DOT recognizes that some solutions proposed through this Challenge may also be applicable to dual-mode vehicles - capable of both driverless operation and operation by a conventional driver for a complete trip.</li>\n  <li>In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-14]), Congress reallocated $100 million for “. . . a highly automated vehicle (HAV) research and development program,” a portion of which is being used to fund this Challenge. The accompanying Explanatory Statement further clarified: “Of the total amount provided, not less than $38,000,000 shall be used for direct research, including administrative expenses, on HAV and [Advanced Driver Assistance System] technologies by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration, of which no more than $5,000,000 shall be for ADAS research. For the purposes of the agreement, HAV refers to technologies capable of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) DOT Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automation, whereas ADAS refers to technologies capable of Level 1 or Level 2” (Division L, Title 1). DOT previously used the term HAV to refer to vehicles with Level 3-5 driving automation, but subsequently adopted the terminology in SAE J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.</li>\n</ol>\n",

            "description": "<p>Women continue to be underrepresented at nearly every institution of higher education in the United States in the fields of biomedical, behavioral sciences, and engineering. This is particularly true among mid- to senior-level faculty ranks.</p>\n\n<p>The Prize for Enhancing Faculty Gender Diversity seeks to recognize those institutions whose biomedical and behavioral science departments, centers, or divisions have achieved sustained improvement in gender diversity.  Understanding that there is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to enhancing diversity in academia and that ideas based on evidence are necessary to achieve systemic change, this prize will acknowledge and recognize transformative approaches, systems, projects, programs, and processes that have successfully enhanced and sustained gender diversity within an institution.</p>\n\n<p>We recognize that challenges are faced by all underrepresented groups. Women of color, who are at the intersection of gender and race/ethnicity, face unique obstacles and are especially underrepresented as biomedical faculty members and in the leadership ranks. Although this competition focuses on improving gender diversity broadly for all women, the NIH is also interested in institutional approaches that address the underrepresentation of faculty with intersecting identities.</p>\n\n<p>Critical to this prize competition is the identification of best practices, the sharing of lessons learned, and the delineation of evidence-based approaches that can be broadly translated to, and replicated by, other institutions vis-à-vis an NIH-supported national toolkit. Submissions to this prize competition may inform the development of the toolkit, which will be designed to assist other institutions or academic groups with issues of inclusion and help to create environments that facilitate achievement. Because this prize competition recognizes achievement through approaches that have already been applied, such interventions must have been implemented prior to the launch date of this prize competition.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to public recognition for their efforts in enhancing gender diversity, this NIH prize competition will also award a prize of $50,000 to each institution (up to ten institutions) with the best overall systemic approaches. The total prize purse for this competition is $500,000. Additional submissions may be recognized as honorable mentions with non-monetary awards. Winning participants and honorable mentions may be invited to present their approaches at an NIH Office of Research for Women’s Health hosted scientific symposium.</p>\n\n<p>To register for this prize competition and for full submission details, see the HeroX website:  <a href=\"https://www.herox.com/NIHGenderDiversityPrize\">https://www.herox.com/NIHGenderDiversityPrize</a></p>\n",

Recognizing that disparities exist amongst institutions, judges will evaluate entries in two pools to allow for fair competition. Five of the ten prizes will be awarded to low or limited-resource institutions.  Submissions from low or limited-resource institutions will be judged against one another to select those five winners.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"non-monetary-prizes\">Non-monetary Prizes</h4>\n\n<p>Additional submissions may be recognized as honorable mentions with non-monetary awards.

            "description": "<p><em>“Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning are paving the way to automate business processes … Let us ride the digital wave of transformation together.” – Keith Nakasone, Deputy Assistant Commissioner for Acquisition, General Services Administration (GSA)</em></p>\n\n<p><em>“AI &amp; ML leveraged successfully are force multipliers; transitioning historically resource intensive activities into high-speed-low-drag transactions.  Huge thank you in advance for your participation and contributions!” – Sean C. Zerges, Director, Office of the Chief Technology Officer, GSA</em></p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to develop an artificial intelligence (AI), or machine learning (ML) solution that will review end-user license agreements (EULA) for terms and conditions that are unacceptable to the government. On average it takes all parties involved approximately 7-14 days to review an EULA and ensure that all unacceptable terms and conditions are identified.</p>\n\n<p>A EULA details the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of software or services. It can also be known as a software license agreement or acceptable use policy. As part of the acquisition process of software or services, GSA reviews the associated EULAs. This review must be completed prior to awarding new contracts or modifying existing contracts. A GSA contracting officer (CO) reviews applicable EULAs for terms and conditions that are not in accordance with Federal law and regulations. The CO may also coordinate a legal review with the Office of General Counsel if they feel it is warranted. Should EULAs contain language that would conflict with Federal law and regulations, the CO must negotiate changes to the EULA to remove the problematic language.</p>\n\n<p>We are looking for a solution that will use AI and/or ML to improve this manual process. The solution will include a user interface that GSA will use to process the documents and identify unacceptable clauses/terms in the EULAs. <strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/uOBFIqoOJ8k\">Watch our AI / ML challenge video</a> to learn more about the desired solution.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This solution will decrease the time spent manually reviewing EULAs and free resources to focus on other aspects of the acquisition process.  It will also improve the accuracy and consistency of the review process.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"data-provided\">Data Provided:</h4>\n\n<p>All Solvers (individuals, teams, or legal entities) shall have access to the following data for use in creating their solutions.

Additional resources are also posted with this update.</h4>\n\n<p>This year, we’ve been forced to rethink the myriad of different ways we connect, socialize and interact with each other. In the absence of face-to-face time, can technology and online tools help us make, maintain, and strengthen those connections so vital to everyday life? We believe they can. That’s why we need your help.</p>\n\n<p>Can you design an easy-to-use online directory of social engagement programs and technology tools and products that matches end-users who are socially isolated with customized suggestions, tailored to meet their specific needs, interests, and abilities, in one seamless end-to-end experience? Then we want to hear from you.</p>\n\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL) along with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, are offering up to $750,000 in prizes and an opportunity to reach up to 10 million Americans. The prize will be awarded to the winner at the CES in January 2021. ACL and OASH are joined by the Consumer Technology Association Foundation (CTA Foundation), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in promoting the competition and judging and/or evaluating the submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Are you up to the challenge? Learn more about the competition and how to apply below.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"backgroundissue\">Background/Issue</h4>\n\n<p>The number of people in the United States aged 65 or older will almost double from 49 million in 2020 to 95 million by the year 2060 comprising nearly one quarter of the total US population. Among the senior population, nearly 25% of Americans aged 65-and-over are considered to be socially isolated - “the objective state of having few social relationships or infrequent social contact with others” - while 43% of those 60-and-over report feeling lonely.</p>\n\n<p>A constellation of harmful health outcomes have been associated with isolation and loneliness including premature mortality, a higher risk for developing dementia, heart failure and stroke, and increased risk of hospitalizations. In light of these health risk factors, it is unsurprising that analyses of Medicare spending has revealed an additional $6.7 billion spent annually on enrollees who are socially isolated.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance in fostering the development of innovative solutions to combat the harmful effects of these risk factors and the role technology has in addressing social isolation and loneliness, in March 2019, the White House National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released a report on “Emerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population.”</p>\n\n<p>The challenges brought forth by social isolation and loneliness has come to the fore during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  As the nation continues to adhere to public health recommendations of social distancing, an increasingly recognized secondary outcome is the risk social distancing can have on rates of loneliness and social isolation especially among our nation’s most vulnerable populations including older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes and our nation’s Veterans population.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>While there are an array of technologies and social engagement programs in the marketplace, there are considerable gaps in both awareness of and access to these technologies and programming for those individuals most likely to be lonely and isolated. Consequently, there is an opportunity to increase access and awareness to technologies and social engagement programming.</p>\n\n<p>ACL and OASH are pleased to announce the <strong>M</strong>obilizing and <strong>E</strong>mpowering the <strong>N</strong>ation and <strong>T</strong>echnology to <strong>A</strong>ddress <strong>L</strong>oneliness &amp; social isolation (MENTAL)  Health Innovation Challenge to address this need. Supporting partners include the VA, FCC, and the CTA Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>With this health innovation challenge we hope to recognize innovative ideas and solutions that seek to develop a software platform that increases awareness of, access to and use of social engagement technologies and programming to help curtail the impact of loneliness and social isolation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge asks care partners, local communities, businesses, non-profit organizations, institutions, healthcare providers, technologists, academics, among others in the global community for innovative solutions to combat loneliness and social isolation in vulnerable populations including Veterans, older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes that may be isolated from visitors and family members during a quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to increase consumer awareness and use of technology tools that keep older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations, and Veterans socially engaged and connected to families, friends, communities and activities of interest. The Challenge is seeking solutions that assess socially isolated individuals and match them with appropriate technology tools and social engagement programming that best meet their needs. The winning solution will become part of a public-private campaign to reach up to 10 million socially isolated older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans.  Successful solutions will build from existing assessments, technology tools, and utilize state of the art matching algorithms to address the following topic area:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic Area: Increase Awareness and Use of Technology and Social Engagement Programming Through an Accessible Social Engagement Clearinghouse</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Create an accessible technology and social engagement clearinghouse that catalogs and links the array of technology, apps and social engagement programming resources.</li>\n  <li>Allow consumers to be matched to appropriate technology tools and programs based on their identified needs, interests, and abilities. This will require the design of a consumer interface and a user friendly assessment process that can inform the development of algorithms to match individuals to technology tools and social engagement programming that would best meet their needs and interests.</li>\n  <li>Design a user centered process to enable a seamless end to end experience for an individual in identifying, acquiring/accessing and using appropriate solutions to address their social isolation. This would include making informed decisions on options, enrolling into selected programs, acquiring technology, and securing training necessary to use selected solutions. The Social Engagement Clearinghouse will be interoperable, enable real-time indicators on program, technology and service availability, and enable assessment and screening information to be pushed by the consumer to their provider(s) of choice or whoever is supporting their care needs.</li>\n  <li>Propose a mechanism to include and update user reviews and other information about usability, quality, accessibility and availability of social engagement programming and technology tools that informs individual decisions about which products to select.</li>\n  <li>Pilot the use of the assessment and clearinghouse in a variety of settings including Aging and Disability Resource Centers.</li>\n  <li>The user interface of prototypes should be designed with a feedback loop to continue to assess quality and accessibility of experience during the pilot.</li>\n  <li>Evaluation of the pilot should also include the performance of the matching algorithms, the ability of the individual to enroll in selected social engagement programs and acquire the selected technology, and the impact the selected social engagement programs and technology tools have had on increasing the individual’s level of social engagement (i.e. reducing social isolation).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this challenge should include a team of key stakeholders with relevant technical expertise as well as knowledge in technologies and programs that address social isolation. Preference will be given to teams that coordinate with or are informed by a state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/vdc.html\">ADRC/No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a>. Since 2003, states and community-based organizations (CBOs) have invested in state NWDs to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD systems include a community-based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge will compete in two phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $750,000.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Open June 23, 2020 through September 14, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Informational Webinar was held on July 9, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Additional Informational Webinar was held on July 30, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Additional Informational Webinar was held on August 12, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Registration email to register for the competition is due ideally by July 15, 2020 and no later than September 14, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Submissions for Phase 1 are due September 14, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Judging for Phase 1 will occur from September 14, 2020 through October 5, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Finalists that move into Phase 2 will be awarded by October 6, 2020.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Phase 2: Pilot and Test Social Engagement Clearinghouse Alpha</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Competition occurs October 6, 2020 through December 4, 2020.</li>\n  <li>Phase 2 submissions are due by December 4, 2020, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Judging occurs December 4, 2020 through December 14, 2020.</li>\n  <li>The top two contenders of Phase 2 will be notified by December 15, 2020.</li>\n  <li>The top two contenders will be asked to present their solution at CES 2021.

            "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) is announcing the Rural Tech Project (Challenge), a new challenge supported with funds reserved under Title IV, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) for purposes of technical assistance and capacity building to support Title IV, Part A. The Challenge invites rural high schools to bring innovative solutions to the implementation of distance learning-enabled, competency-based technology instruction to prepare students for postsecondary education and careers in the technology workforce of today and tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge seeks solutions that use distance learning to provide rural communities access to competency-based education (CBE) programs in technology-related career pathways with a goal of increasing instructional capacity.</p>\n\n<p>Rural communities often lack the instructional capacity to deliver high-quality career and technical education (CTE) in technology education pathways. Distance learning- enabled models can help address capacity constraints by facilitating education delivery with limited staff and minimal or no in-person interaction among instructors or peers, which provides for the potential to increase access to in-demand technology career pathways in rural communities. CBE models allow students to progress at their own pace through a sequence of personalized learning experiences, where students advance their education by demonstrating mastery of a subject or concept. Expanding these models to rural high school students, with a focus on technology pathways, would increase access to qualified educators and expand opportunities for students to earn industry certifications and credentials. The progress of the finalists and the models and practices emerging from the Challenge will be shared on the Challenge website.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-descriptions\">Phase Descriptions</h4>\n\n<p>The Challenge will be conducted in two phases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 1: Open Submissions (June 30 - October 8, 2020)</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>During Phase 1, high schools and local educational agencies (LEAs) enter the Challenge by completing the submission process outlined on the Challenge webpage. Schools should coordinate their entries with their LEAs to ensure the entries represent an aligned effort, if applicable. At least one online informational session will be held during Phase 1.</li>\n      <li><strong>Judging:</strong> Entrants who fulfill the criteria described in the Eligibility section of this announcement and complete a submission that meets all entry requirements in the Submission Information section of this announcement will be eligible for judging. Independent judges will review eligible Phase 1 submissions using the Finalist Selection Criteria, which are included in the Award Selection Criteria section of this announcement and will recommend finalists to the Department. Up to five finalists will be selected from the group of eligible entrants and invited to participate in Phase 2.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 2: Community Implementation (January 2021 - August 2023)</strong>  </p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>During Phase 2, finalists will have the opportunity to receive curated and customized technical assistance to finalize their proposed program plans in preparation for implementation. With support from a local community engagement manager selected by the entrant, finalists will launch programs for a first cohort of students. Finalists will collect data on the first cohorts’ performance metrics, identifying successes and opportunities for improvement. Finalists will evolve program designs and implement program changes while continuing to receive technical assistance. Finalists will also create sustainability plans. After the completion of Phase 2, finalists will document their outcomes and lessons learned in a formal submission for evaluation by the Phase 2 judging panel. This submission will include a detailed description of how schools implemented distance learning-enabled, competency-based technology education; the results and lessons learned from implementation; and effective practices for rural, competency-based technology education program design. The Phase 2 finalist submission will also require documentation of efforts to align programs to one or more technology career paths.</li>\n      <li><strong>Judging:</strong> Independent judges will review Phase 2 submissions using the Winner Selection Criteria, which are included in the Award Selection Criteria section of this announcement, and recommend to the Department which finalist should be selected as a grand prize winner based on the submission. Subject to approval by the Department, finalists may all be eligible to receive an award (to be determined at a later date).</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Visit the official Rural Tech Project website at <a href=\"http://www.RuralTechProject.com\">http://www.RuralTechProject.com</a>.

The goal of this challenge is to find and demonstrate innovative solutions that remove or transport the amount of sediment building up in the reservoirs, replacing available space for water storage, that provide critical water supplies for the country. The build-up of sediment leaves less room for water, and less water means that our reservoirs eventually may not be able to meet the demand of the communities we serve. Such impacts have been experienced at some Reclamation reservoirs and are anticipated to occur more frequently in the future.  Reclamation’s primary interest is in technology that will move sediment downstream at the average annual rate at which it would otherwise accumulate but approaches that can help regain lost reservoir capacity are of interest if they can do so in addition to meeting environmental and other performance criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about the competition here: <a href=\"http://www.herox.com/GuardiansoftheReservoir\">http://www.herox.com/GuardiansoftheReservoir</a>.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) helps power and secure America’s future and ensure the country’s role as a leader in science and technology. In 2015, the Secretary of Energy authorized the formation of the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) to be responsible for developing and overseeing delivery of DOE’s strategic vision and goals for technology commercialization and engagement with the business and industrial sectors across the United States. OTT’s mission is to expand the commercial impact and public benefit of DOE’s research and development portfolio to advance the economic, energy, and national security interests of the Nation. </p>\n\n<p>Energy startups and innovative technologies are critical to the growth of the energy economy in the United States and abroad. Startups drive technology development, business model innovation, and job creation. The private sector has had difficulty providing sufficient capital, business development services, and entrepreneurial training to early-stage, high-risk, longer-term, capital-intensive technologies, like those required for transforming the nation’s energy systems. </p>\n\n<p>Strong business incubation services—including, but not limited to, mentoring, entrepreneurial training, access to testing and prototyping assistance—not only provide direct support for early-stage startups, but also have the potential to de-risk the startups for follow-on investors. Incubators have the potential to accelerate regional economic development, strengthen national innovation capacity, and expand domestic energy-related manufacturing. By providing due diligence, screening applicant companies, assisting with prototyping, connecting entrepreneurs with manufacturers, and advising startups to prudently use their capital on vital services, incubators play a critical role in supporting startups as they transition into the market.</p>\n\n<p>The EPIC prize seeks to recognize the most novel, comprehensive, and impactful incubator plans that focus on developing strong innovation clusters, connections, and support for energy-related technology and entrepreneurial innovation. Prize competitors will develop a strategic plan to create or bolster innovation clusters through regional engagement, including engagement of other private actors—both for- and non-profit—as well as state and local entities that can provide additional resources. \nThe prize seeks to address a capital gap in supporting these critical organizations by providing funds to be applied where incubators need them most. Providing capital to enable creative, forward-thinking organizations is critical to allow organizations to think more expansively about the role of incubators in the broader regional and national innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem. Further, it is DOE’s hope that this funding will enable winners of this prize to enhance their organization’s resilience and operational sustainability.</p>\n",

However, fertilizers applied without consideration of the appropriate rate, timing, source, and method, can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other next generation product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-details\">Challenge Details</h4>\n\n<p>To help mitigate potential adverse environmental effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the Joint EPA-USDA Partnership and Competition on Next Gen Fertilizers to Advance Agricultural Sustainability in the United States. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is in collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA).</p>\n\n<p>This Partnership is being coordinated with input from stakeholders such as corn grower representatives, fertilizer companies, university and government researchers, and environmental and industry NGOs. This competition includes two challenges which aim to accelerate the development and use of existing and new product technologies that are affordable to reduce the environmental impacts of U.S. corn production. The results of the Partnership may ultimately be leveraged to improve production of other crops under a range of environmental conditions in the U.S. and abroad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge:</strong> This Challenge aims to identify concepts for novel technologies for fertilizers and other product technology innovations that can reduce the environmental effects from modern agriculture while maintaining or increasing crop yields. Submissions to the Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge may include technologies that are not currently on the market or technology concepts that are not traditional EEFs and not in commercial use as a fertilizer.</p>\n\n<p>For the challenge dealing with existing product technologies, go to the <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/eefs-environmental-agronomic-challenge/\">EEFs: Environmental and Agronomic Challenge</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<p>NextGen Fertilizer Challenge Dates:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Launch: 9:00 AM ET August 26, 2020</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://next_gen_fertilizer_challenges.eventbrite.com/\">Informational Webinar</a>: 10:00 AM ET September 24, 2020</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://innocentive.wazoku.com/#/challenge/4380f517f84f49b78ad3dab8b4657e6e?searchIndex=2\">Registration* Deadline and Submission End</a>: 11:59 PM ET, November 30, 2020</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: Winter 2020/2021 (date and time to be determined)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>*Register via InnoCentive</p>\n\n<p>For more information please visit EPA’s page for the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/innovation/next-gen-fertilizer-challenges\">Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges</a>.</p>\n",

            "description": "<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n\n<p>Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers facilitate the growth of crops, including corn, at yields that provide sustained global food production. However, fertilizers applied without consideration of the appropriate rate, timing, source, and method, can have harmful effects on the environment and human health. “Enhanced Efficiency Fertilizer” (EEF) is a term for new formulations that control fertilizer release or alter reactions that reduce nutrient losses to the environment. EEFs and other product technology innovations may be an important addition to a system of conservation practices that help reduce the impacts from row crop agriculture on the environment, while maintaining or increasing agricultural productivity and profitability.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Details</strong></p>\n\n<p>To help mitigate potential adverse environmental effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is partnering with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to launch the Joint EPA-USDA Partnership and Competition on Next Gen Fertilizers to Advance Agricultural Sustainability in the United States. Along with EPA and USDA, the competition is in collaboration with The Fertilizer Institute (TFI), the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), and the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA).</p>\n\n<p>This Partnership is being coordinated with input from stakeholders such as corn grower representatives, fertilizer companies, university and government researchers, and environmental and industry NGOs. This competition includes two challenges which aim to accelerate the development and use of existing and new product technologies that are affordable to reduce the environmental impacts of U.S. corn production. The results of the Partnership may ultimately be leveraged to improve production of other crops under a range of environmental conditions in the U.S. and abroad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EEFs: Environmental and Agronomic Challenge:</strong> This Challenge aims to identify existing EEFs currently on or near-market that meet or exceed certain environmental and agro-economic criteria. The Challenge is planned to have 3 stages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stage 1: Potential solvers will submit information describing the EEF and how it is anticipated to meet the requirements. Submissions will be reviewed by an expert judging panel.</li>\n  <li>Stage 2: A subset of Stage 1 solvers will be invited to submit physical products in order to compete in planned greenhouse testing.</li>\n  <li>Stage 3: Potential for field trials following Stage 2 greenhouse testing, locations to be determined.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the challenge dealing with concepts for novel technologies for fertilizers and other product technology innovations, go to the <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/next-gen-fertilizer-innovations-challenge/\">Next Gen Fertilizer Innovation Challenge</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates:</h4>\n\n<p>EEF Environmental and Agronomic Challenge Dates:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Launch: 9:00 AM ET August 26, 2020</li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://next_gen_fertilizer_challenges.eventbrite.com/\">Informational Webinar</a>:  10:00 AM ET September 24, 2020 </li>\n  <li>Submission End: 11:59 PM ET October 30, 2020 (<strong>Submission deadline passed - no more submissions being accepted</strong>)</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: Winter 2020/2021 (date and time to be determined)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For more information please visit EPA’s page for the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/innovation/next-gen-fertilizer-challenges\">Next Gen Fertilizer Challenges</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/innovation/next-gen-fertilizer-challenges#FAQs\">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>\n",

            "judging": "<h4 id=\"judging-panel\">Judging Panel</h4>\n\n<p>A panel of subject matter experts selected by EPA, USDA and the Challenge collaborators will judge submissions based on pre-defined scoring criteria. The panel will initially screen submissions for completeness and relevance. The selected eligible applications will then be judged using the criteria specified below. Judges will be selected based on several criteria, including their technical expertise (e.g. chemistry, agronomy, microbiology, biogeochemistry, ecology), geography (e.g. Midwest, South, etc.), associations with land grant universities, sectoral experience (e.g. farming, academia, government, industry), and diversity. All judges will be required to sign Conflict of Interest (COI) agreement to ensure unbiased reviews, and Non-Disclosure agreements to ensure confidentiality of any CBI. All persons or entities that submit a solution will be notified as to the status of their submission and a high-level evaluation. Decisions cannot be contested.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"judging-criteria\">Judging Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>For Stage 1, the Judging Panel will evaluate submissions based on four performance areas, which will be allotted points (up to a total of 100). Submissions invited to Stage 2 will submit a physical product for testing at the IFDC based on agreed-upon protocols.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Scoring Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 1.</strong> Within performance areas, there are additional criteria that will be evaluated. For example, there are five environmental and three agronomic criteria:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Environmental performance: 35 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching/runoff: 7 points</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching/runoff: 7 points</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization: 7 points</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions: 7 points</li>\n      <li>No toxic residue left on the field or in the runoff or leachate: 7 points (For the purposes of this Challenge, “toxic residues” refers to prevalent and biologically active degradates formed from decomposition (via either biotic and abiotic processes) of the product in the environment. Please include the names and unique CAS numbers (if available) for any active and inactive ingredients of the solution and its degradants. Toxicity and prevalence can be described by a number of means, including existing eco-toxicology and environmental fate studies, summaries from either the <a href=\"https://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard\">EPA CompTox Chemicals Dashboard</a> or the <a href=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/ecotox/\">EPA ECOTOX Knowledgebase</a>, or whether the constituent chemicals are already listed under the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/saferchoice/safer-ingredients\">EPA Safer Chemical Ingredients List</a>. Although this criteria does not pertain to inhibitor effects on target organisms (e.g., soil bacteria), which are toxic by design, it does pertain to any decomposition byproducts of inhibitors and other potential solutions, and effects that may occur for non-target organisms)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Agronomic performance: 35 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield relative to conventional fertilizer: 15 points</li>\n      <li>Return on investment (ROI): 10 points</li>\n      <li>Compatibility with existing supply chain machinery and practices: 10 points</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Other performance criteria: 20 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Addresses multiple loss pathways: 10 points</li>\n      <li>Applicability to other crops and environmental conditions: 5 points</li>\n      <li>Market penetration: 5 points</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Expert discretion points: 10 points</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Judging Panel will assign points to metrics and criteria based on the rubric above and their combined expert judgement given the degree of information submitted in the solutions. This “scorecard” will be made available to the Solver at the announcement of Stage 1 winners.</p>\n\n<p>The example rubric above is for a solution that addresses N and P. For solutions that address only one nutrient (e.g. N), the possible points for the other nutrient (e.g. P) will be zeroed out such that the total points possible will be less than 100 (i.e. 90 points possible for N-only solution, 80 total points possible for P-only solution).</p>\n\n<p>As an example, the following are qualities of an ideal solution:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Compatible with existing corn farming machinery and practices;</li>\n  <li>Reduces N and P leaching and runoff by 45% or more;</li>\n  <li>Reduces NH3 volatilization by 25% or more;</li>\n  <li>Reduces N2O emissions by 25% or more;</li>\n  <li>Does not leave any toxic residue after degradation;</li>\n  <li>Increases yield;</li>\n  <li>Is estimated to be a net profit for farmers (i.e. the revenue from yield increases offset the up-front cost increases for the new technology);</li>\n  <li>Has good environmental and agronomic performance under a range of environmental conditions;</li>\n  <li>Is widely available and potentially applicable to other crops.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Stage 2.</strong> The planned IFDC trials are designed to evaluate a key subset of the criteria and metrics above. The greenhouse and laboratory trials will yield information on four environmental and three agronomic criteria. We will use a similar scoring rubric as with Stage 1, but with modifications since the IFDC trials will not test for certain criteria (e.g. toxicity of residue, compatibility with existing machinery).</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Environmental performance: 50 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N leaching</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of P leaching</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of NH3 volatilization</li>\n      <li>Reduction relative to conventional fertilizer of N2O emissions</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Agronomic performance: 50 points</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yield relative to conventional fertilizer</li>\n      <li>Nitrogen use efficiency</li>\n      <li>Phosphorus use efficiency</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Draft protocols for the planned IFDC greenhouse tests are available by request. Additional details of the IFDC scoring and testing protocols will be made following announcement of the Stage 1 winners, and will depend on the number of EEFs and soil types to be tested.</p>\n",

These changes are reflected in the Key Dates table below.</p>\n\n<p>The US Army Medical Research and Development Command (MRDC) is announcing the xTech Brain Operant Learning Technology – xTechBOLT – prize competition.  The prize competition is designed to incentivize industry to develop and demonstrate the use of one or more tool(s) (e.g., QEEG, fMRI, MEG, BIOMRK, NIRS, PET, MEA, SPECT, or other) to locate, track, and trace four types of learning traits, including explicit and implicit knowledge, from exposure to storage, and use those neural pathways to capture emotions and empathy and research a proof of concept mechanism (software or hardware, or both) that could be developed to promote optimal retention and access to memories.</p>\n\n<p>The goals for this competition are to understand the effects of emotion and empathy on learning and memory and the functional roles played by various brain regions and their mutual interactions in relation to emotional and empathetic processing and effect on both implicit and explicit learning.  Understanding these effects will help build the United States Military of the future, by revolutionizing how we teach and train Warfighters, how we build better medical providers, and how we utilize novel brain operant learning technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The Army (and more broadly the U.S. Department of Defense) seek “path finding” teams and technologies through this competition. Therefore, xTechBOLT is not interested in low-risk, repackaged approaches of tried and true techniques. We aim to find early-stage innovations with the potential to dramatically improve military training outcomes with novel hardware- and/or software-based technologies.</p>\n\n<p>xTechBOLT is seeking applicants to use one or more tool(s) (e.g., QEEG, fMRI, MEG, BIOMRK, NIRS, PET, MEA, SPECT, or other) to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Locate, track, and trace four types of learning traits including explicit and implicit knowledge from exposure to storage, and use those neural pathways to capture emotions and empathy from exposure to storage;</li>\n  <li>Research a proof of concept technology which may include software or hardware, or both that could be developed to promote optimal retention and access to memories.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Army recognizes that it must enhance engagements with innovative problem solvers, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of technologies under development commercially that may benefit the Army; (2) integrating small business innovators into the Army’s Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the Army.</p>\n\n<p>The xTechBOLT competition will provide increasing non-dilutive prizes to select applicants to proceed in the competition.  All applications will be reviewed by Army subject matter experts and up to 10 applicants with the highest ranking concept white papers will receive a prize of $10,000 each and advance to give a pitch on their proposed concept to a live Army judging panel.  The live judging panel will select five (5) applicants to receive additional awards of $25,000 each and be invited to present a proof-of-concept of their technology solutions at the 2021 Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) in Orlando, Florida.

Receive timely updates on CTE Mission: CubeSat by signing up for the newsletter.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"about-the-challenge\">About the Challenge</h4>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Education (the Department) is announcing CTE Mission: CubeSat (the Challenge), a Challenge funded by the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 as amended by the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act (Perkins V). The Challenge calls upon eligible high schools to design and build CubeSat prototypes.</p>\n\n<p>The specifications of CubeSats that were adopted by the commercial satellite industry reduce the time and cost to design, build, and launch a satellite, making orbital missions more accessible for both commercial and educational use. For the purpose of this Challenge, and to reduce production time, high schools will be encouraged to build a CubeSat Prototype using more accessible, low-fidelity materials (e.g., 3D-printed material, wood, plastic, or other materials) that meet the standard CubeSat dimensions adopted by industry and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</p>\n\n<p>A CubeSat Prototype can be flown and tested using various flight methods that effectively simulate a low-altitude launch, such as, but not limited to, tethered balloons, amateur rockets, drones, or small aircraft.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"why-participate\">Why Participate</h4>\n\n<p>By participating in the Challenge, students and educators will gain an understanding of the phases involved in designing, building, and launching a satellite. The Challenge focuses on select elements of the CubeSat development process to enable students to experience as much of the design, build, and flight stages on a timeline significantly shorter than NASA estimates to be typically 18-24 months to build a CubeSat and a few months to a few years to launch a CubeSat into orbit.\nUsing CubeSat Prototypes, rather than space-ready CubeSats, enables schools to participate in the Challenge and conduct a test flight without the need for design and testing approvals that CubeSats entering orbit require.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-descriptions\">Phase Descriptions</h4>\n\n<p>The Challenge will be conducted in two phases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 1 Mission Design (August – December 2020):</strong></p>\n\n    <p>Potential entrants will receive support through curated and customized online resources as they develop their Mission Proposals and consider various flight methods to launch their CubeSat Prototypes (e.g., balloons, drones, or other locally available launch vehicles). At least one online information session will be held during this phase.  Potential entrants may enter the Challenge by submitting a Mission Proposal that will include descriptions of objectives, materials needed, plans for prototyping, proposed flight method, and team details.</p>\n\n    <p>Entrants who fulfill the criteria described in the <a href=\" https://www.ctemissioncubesat.com/eligibility/\">Eligibility section</a> and complete a submission that meets the requirements of a Mission Proposal will be eligible to proceed into the judging process, and if selected, participate in Phase 2 as a finalist.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Judging:</strong> Independent judges will review Mission Proposals using the <em>Finalist Selection Criteria</em>, which are included in the <em>Judging Criteria</em> section of this notice and make recommendations to the Department as to which entrants should be selected as finalists. Up to five finalists will be selected from the group of eligible entrants based on submitted Mission Proposals and invited to participate in Phase 2.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Phase 2 Mission Build and Launch (January – May 2021):</strong></p>\n\n    <p>During Phase 2, finalists will implement their Mission Proposal by building a CubeSat Prototype and planning flight events where they will each launch their prototype using their proposed flight method. Finalists will receive mentorship and additional virtual resources to support them throughout the self-paced mission build process. Flight events must be conducted by the date and time determined by the Department which will be published on the Challenge webpage. Following the flight event, finalists will submit a Flight Report that includes a detailed description of the flight experience, results, lessons learned, flight data, visual documentation (e.g., photographs and/or videos), a detailed flight event planning checklist, a description of the functional CubeSat Prototype, a description of other devices and equipment required for their selected flight method, and a project budget.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Judging:</strong> Independent judges may review Flight Reports using the <em>Winner Selection Criteria</em>, which are included in the <em>Judging Criteria</em> section of this notice and make recommendations to the Department as to which finalists should be selected as winners based on submitted Flight Reports.</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n",

For more information about the webinar and to register to attend, visit <a href=\"www.epa.gov/innovation/informational-webinar-innovative-ways-destroy-pfas-challenge\"></a><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/innovation/informational-webinar-innovative-ways-destroy-pfas-challenge\">https://www.epa.gov/innovation/informational-webinar-innovative-ways-destroy-pfas-challenge</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>EPA is partnering with the U.S. Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) and Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP); the Environmental Council of States (ECOS) and the Environmental Research Institute of the States (ERIS); Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, to launch a technical challenge regarding the destruction of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The challenge asks Solvers to submit detailed plans for a non-thermal way of destroying PFAS in concentrated aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), while creating the least amount of potentially harmful byproducts.</p>\n\n<p>PFAS are a group of synthetic chemicals that have been widely used for more than 60 years to make plastics, firefighting foams, and lubricants, and to help make products stain-resistant, waterproof, and nonstick. Addressing and managing PFAS in the environment is one of the most pressing issues facing EPA and its partners. This issue is particularly challenging because PFAS chemicals have a very strong carbon-fluorine chemical bond that leads to persistence in the environment and makes their complete destruction extremely difficult. Given the ubiquitous nature of PFAS and increasing public concerns, EPA and its partners are looking for greater certainty when making decisions about disposal and treatment of PFAS containing materials and PFAS contaminated media/waste.</p>\n\n<p>Although PFAS compounds can be found at different concentrations in various waste streams including aqueous film forming foam (AFFF), biosolids, ground water, sludge and soil, the challenge is focused on unused AFFF. Currently, EPA is investigating all methods of destroying PFAS. Incineration has been used to treat PFAS-contaminated media, and EPA scientists are collaborating with the private sector to evaluate the effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies to completely destroy PFAS. The goal of this challenge is to discover new non-thermal technologies and approaches that remove at least 99 percent of PFAS in unused AFFF while preventing the creation of harmful byproducts.</p>\n",

These solutions will provide the computer vision and NR metric research communities training datasets to ultimately improve analytics for public safety.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-background\">Challenge Background</h4>\n\n<p>A roadblock to the deployment of public safety computer vision and video analytics is the myriad problems cameras have when deployed in real world environments.</p>\n\n<p>First responders operate in environments that are very challenging for cameras. Frequently problems include low light, night with bright lights, and the rising or setting sun shining directly into the camera. Obscurants like rain, snow, and airborne dust obscure distant objects. Bodycams and in-car cameras produce severe camera jiggle. First responders often rely on a third party’s outdated camera systems that provide low resolution video feeds or low-quality compression. Lenses may be obscured by spider webs, restaurant grease, or other grime. First responders need robust computer vision systems that can operate in these difficult environments.</p>\n\n<p>To develop robust systems for public safety, computer vision researchers need an algorithm that predicts the quality of images and videos and performs root cause analysis (RCA). These are referred to as NR metric for image quality assessment (IQA) or video quality assessment (VQA). The NR metric would supplement the camera feed with extra information, such as noting areas of the image where the camera cannot “see.” Deployed systems could implement complex strategies, such as dynamically selecting the optimal video analytic or adjusting camera settings.</p>\n\n<p>Today, NR metrics emulate the human perceptual system. This requires subjective testing, where large groups of people assess the quality of images or videos, so the training datasets are small and expensive. Consequently, NR metrics are too inaccurate for computer vision applications. An additional problem is that most NR metrics only predict overall quality. Computer vision applications need RCA to identify and respond to specific image and video quality problems. Therefore, PSCR is seeking image and video datasets to train NR metric RCA algorithms, as well as strategies for creating this training data. The dataset creation strategies could enable a new line of research.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"challenge-goals-and-objectives\">Challenge Goals and Objectives</h4>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to enhance the research capacity of NR metrics, computer vision algorithms, and image quality analysis for public safety officials. This challenge also seeks to convene members of these disparate research communities to advance the state of image and video quality analysis for public safety.</p>\n\n<p>PSCR hypothesizes that developing new training datasets for NR metric research can replace expensive subjective testing with accuracy estimates from computer vision algorithms. This will help PSCR achieve the development of robust image and video analytics for public safety applications. Each dataset solution can either focus on a Specific Camera Impairment (e.g., lens flare) or a Specific Computer Vision Application (e.g., automated driving). Each dataset will include the following elements:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>250+ images or videos (5 seconds duration or less) that portray a wide range of visual quality, subject matter, and environmental conditions</li>\n  <li>Numerical data that estimates the likelihood that a computer vision application will fail</li>\n  <li>Category data that can be used to subdivide the images into useful subsets</li>\n  <li>A short document that describes the dataset and assessment method</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>After the challenge, the datasets will be used for image quality research and development (R&amp;D) purposes. This will provide the research community with valuable datasets. If the contestant chooses to distribute the images or videos, the datasets will be distributed via the National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) Consumer Digital Video Library (CDVL). NTIA, a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, conducts NR metric research and provides PSCR with video quality assessment expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Contestants will:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Create and distribute a set of images or videos (5 seconds duration or less) that represent either a) one Specific Camera Impairment with content suitable for various computer vision applications, or b) a variety of camera impairments with content suitable for a Single Computer Vision Application. All images and videos must be from modern cameras (i.e., no synthetic or simulated impairments). At the contestant’s discretion, these images or videos will be freely distributed for research and development purposes following the conclusion of the challenge.</li>\n  <li>Create a method to assess the failure rates of a specific computer vision algorithm and apply this method to the contestant’s images or videos. Possible solutions include but are not limited to correct classification rate, misclassification rate, likelihood score, image ambiguity, image difficulty, and meta-recognition. The failure rates must be expressed as a percentage or fraction. The method must be described in sufficient detail that another researcher or developer could apply the method to their own images or videos, using their own computer vision algorithm. At the contestant’s discretion, the contestant may optionally identify areas of the image or video where the computer vision algorithm fails.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For this challenge, failure rate is whether or not the computer vision algorithm can make a reliable decision. Contestants should choose a method to assess failure rate that is synergistic with this challenge’s goal of understanding how camera impairments impact computer vision algorithms. Contestants should apply the reliability measure that is most appropriate to the application of choice based on the current state of the art. Of most interest are (a) failure rate assessment methods that can be applied to any computer vision system, and (b) failure rate assessment methods designed for computer vision algorithms that specifically target public safety and first responder needs.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phases\">Phases</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Concept Paper</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Concept Paper phase invites all eligible contestants to submit a concept paper outlining their proposed solution, approach, capabilities, knowledge, and skills for this contest. Contestants must document their proposed solution structure for either of the two dataset categories. Contestants will also need to demonstrate their experience with image quality analysis, video quality analysis, computer vision, engineering, photography, or other abilities to create the proposed solution. Contestants who propose using a computer vision algorithm to create assessment data will need to demonstrate their experience with computer vision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Dataset Submission</strong></p>\n\n<p>During Phase 2 of the challenge, invited contestants will implement their proposals and submit datasets according to the Requirements below. Datasets will consist of images or videos that contain different scenes or different impairments to quality. The datasets will also include a computer vision failure rate for each image or video, and a general description of how the failure rates were derived. During evaluation, the Judging panel will score each submission based on the evaluation criteria.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"blob:https://www.challenge.gov/85a9bbf0-8e95-4bf8-8e44-747d5f035d45\" alt=\"Challenge Timeline\" title=\"Challenge Timeline\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary of Important Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1, Concept Paper</strong>: Open for submissions beginning September 8, 2020, with concept papers due October 20, 2020; Winners will be notified by October 30, 2020.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2, Dataset Submission</strong>: Open for submissions on November 3, 2020, with datasets due May 4, 2021; Winners will be notified by May 19, 2021.</p>\n",

These updates will be reviewed at the MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge webinar on August 12, 2020.  A link to register for the webinar is included below.</h4>\n\n<p>This year, we’ve been forced to rethink the myriad of different ways we connect, socialize and interact with each other. In the absence of face-to-face time, can technology and online tools help us make, maintain, and strengthen those connections so vital to everyday life? We believe they can. That’s why we need your help.</p>\n\n<p>Can you design an easy-to-use online directory of social engagement programs and technology tools and products that matches end-users who are socially isolated with customized suggestions, tailored to meet their specific needs, interests, and abilities, in one seamless end-to-end experience? Then we want to hear from you.</p>\n\n<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL) along with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, are offering up to $750,000 in prizes and an opportunity to reach up to 10 million Americans. The prize will be awarded to the winner at the CES in January 2021. ACL and OASH are joined by the Consumer Technology Association Foundation (CTA Foundation), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in promoting the competition and judging and/or evaluating the submissions.</p>\n\n<p>Are you up to the challenge? Learn more about the competition and how to apply below.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"backgroundissue\">Background/Issue</h4>\n\n<p>The number of people in the United States aged 65 or older will almost double from 49 million in 2020 to 95 million by the year 2060 comprising nearly one quarter of the total US population. Among the senior population, nearly 25% of Americans aged 65-and-over are considered to be socially isolated - “the objective state of having few social relationships or infrequent social contact with others” - while 43% of those 60-and-over report feeling lonely.</p>\n\n<p>A constellation of harmful health outcomes have been associated with isolation and loneliness including premature mortality, a higher risk for developing dementia, heart failure and stroke, and increased risk of hospitalizations. In light of these health risk factors, it is unsurprising that analyses of Medicare spending has revealed an additional $6.7 billion spent annually on enrollees who are socially isolated.</p>\n\n<p>Recognizing the importance in fostering the development of innovative solutions to combat the harmful effects of these risk factors and the role technology has in addressing social isolation and loneliness, in March 2019, the White House National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) released a report on “Emerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population.”</p>\n\n<p>The challenges brought forth by social isolation and loneliness has come to the fore during the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.  As the nation continues to adhere to public health recommendations of social distancing, an increasingly recognized secondary outcome is the risk social distancing can have on rates of loneliness and social isolation especially among our nation’s most vulnerable populations including older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes and our nation’s Veterans population.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>While there are an array of technologies and social engagement programs in the marketplace, there are considerable gaps in both awareness of and access to these technologies and programming for those individuals most likely to be lonely and isolated. Consequently, there is an opportunity to increase access and awareness to technologies and social engagement programming.</p>\n\n<p>ACL and OASH are pleased to announce the <strong>M</strong>obilizing and <strong>E</strong>mpowering the <strong>N</strong>ation and <strong>T</strong>echnology to <strong>A</strong>ddress <strong>L</strong>oneliness &amp; social isolation (MENTAL) Health Innovation Challenge to address this need. Supporting partners include the VA, FCC, and the CTA Foundation.</p>\n\n<p>With this health innovation challenge we hope to recognize innovative ideas and solutions that seek to develop a software platform that increases awareness of, access to and use of social engagement technologies and programming to help curtail the impact of loneliness and social isolation.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The MENTAL Health Innovation Challenge asks care partners, local communities, businesses, non-profit organizations, institutions, healthcare providers, technologists, academics, among others in the global community for innovative solutions to combat loneliness and social isolation in vulnerable populations including Veterans, older adults, persons with disabilities living alone, racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as those who live in care facilities and group homes that may be isolated from visitors and family members during a quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to increase consumer awareness and use of technology tools that keep older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations, and Veterans socially engaged and connected to families, friends, communities and activities of interest. The Challenge is seeking solutions that assess socially isolated individuals and match them with appropriate technology tools and social engagement programming that best meet their needs. The winning solution will become part of a public-private campaign to reach up to 10 million socially isolated older adults, people with disabilities, racial and minority populations and Veterans.  Successful solutions will build from existing assessments, technology tools, and utilize state of the art matching algorithms to address the following topic area:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic Area: Increase Awareness and Use of Technology and Social Engagement Programming Through an Accessible Social Engagement Clearinghouse</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Create an accessible technology and social engagement clearinghouse that catalogs and links the array of technology, apps and social engagement programming resources.</li>\n  <li>Allow consumers to be matched to appropriate technology tools and programs based on their identified needs, interests, and abilities. This will require the design of a consumer interface and a user friendly assessment process that can inform the development of algorithms to match individuals to technology tools and social engagement programming that would best meet their needs and interests.</li>\n  <li>Design a user centered process to enable a seamless end to end experience for an individual in identifying, acquiring/accessing and using appropriate solutions to address their social isolation. This would include making informed decisions on options, enrolling into selected programs, acquiring technology, and securing training necessary to use selected solutions. The Social Engagement Clearinghouse will be interoperable, enable real-time indicators on program, technology and service availability, and enable assessment and screening information to be pushed by the consumer to their provider(s) of choice or whoever is supporting their care needs.</li>\n  <li>Propose a mechanism to include and update user reviews and other information about usability, quality, accessibility and availability of social engagement programming and technology tools that informs individual decisions about which products to select.</li>\n  <li>Pilot the use of the assessment and clearinghouse in a variety of settings including Aging and Disability Resource Centers.</li>\n  <li>The user interface of prototypes should be designed with a feedback loop to continue to assess quality and accessibility of experience during the pilot.</li>\n  <li>Evaluation of the pilot should also include the performance of the matching algorithms, the ability of the individual to enroll in selected social engagement programs and acquire the selected technology, and the impact the selected social engagement programs and technology tools have had on increasing the individual’s level of social engagement (i.e. reducing social isolation).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this challenge should include a team of key stakeholders with relevant technical expertise as well as knowledge in technologies and programs that address social isolation. Preference will be given to teams that coordinate with or are informed by a state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/vdc.html\">ADRC/No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a>. Since 2003, states and community-based organizations (CBOs) have invested in state NWDs to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD systems include a community-based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge will compete in two phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase.

Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is the most common genetic disorder in the United States (1). About 100,000 Americans are thought to be living with SCD and each year another 1,000 babies are born with it (2).</p>\n\n<p>A specific single mutation in the gene for hemoglobin, when inherited from both parents, causes SCD. The hemoglobin in people living with SCD distorts the shape of the red blood cell into a ‘sickle’ or crescent moon shape that flows poorly through small blood vessels. This can cause problems in virtually any organ by reducing the delivery of oxygen and inflaming the surrounding tissue. The organ damage caused by SCD can result in strokes in the brain, kidney damage, or complications in other organs. SCD also causes significant pain in the affected tissues. This pain, which can begin in childhood, often escalates as people age, severely affecting the quality of life of individuals with SCD (3,4,5). SCD affects the quality of life for those living with it, and the lives of their families and caregivers. They may experience psychological stress, financial problems, medication management pressures (e.g., administering daily medications and managing pain episodes through behavior or lifestyle changes), and conflicts between job obligations and medical appointments because of the unpredictable nature of SCD and its associated complications (6).</p>\n\n<p>A lack of awareness about SCD and its associated complications among the public and affected communities (7,8) can contribute to stigmas associated with SCD, a lack of understanding of how the disease affects individuals and families, and to less than optimal care experienced by many patients (9).</p>\n\n<p><em>Please note that numbers in parentheses in the paragraphs above denote citations that can be found in the <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/bibliography-nhlbi-sickle-cell-challenge.pdf\">bibliography document</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://scdic.rti.org/\">SCD Implementation Consortium</a> (funded by the NHLBI) is testing new approaches to enhance care for SCD and improve health outcomes in eight geographically diverse areas, particularly for young adults. The <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/cure-sickle-cell-initiative\">Cure Sickle Cell Initiative</a> is an NHLBI-led collaborative research effort accelerating the development of genetic therapies for SCD. And the NHLBI’s intramural researchers have developed gene therapy advances using a vector system to deliver a normal hemoglobin gene to blood-forming stem cells more efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>The NHLBI supports these and other innovative research activities for SCD and is seeking to foster improved awareness about SCD and address the associated <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/materials/infographic-5-facts.html\">myths</a> and stigmas by launching the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/grants-and-training/sickle-cell-challenge\">NHLBI Hope for Sickle Cell Disease Challenge</a>. This Challenge incentivizes college and graduate students to develop innovative Tools that build awareness of evidence-based information about SCD. Examples of such Tools include, but are not limited to, a video (documentaries, testimonials, etc.), a software application, a game (board, computer, interactive, etc.), a website, a book (children’s books, k-12 learning tools, etc.), a marketing campaign, a social media campaign, music or a song, a grassroots campaign, or an exhibit. The Tools created for this Challenge should undergo pilot testing and be evaluated using a rigorous scientific assessment. Knowledge dissemination and transfer may improve patient outcomes by (i) increasing public awareness of SCD, particularly those who have been underserved and including young adult populations and K-12 youth; (ii) providing individuals, caregivers, and families affected by SCD accurate and easily understandable information about SCD and its complications; and (iii) educating healthcare providers about pain and opioid management.</p>\n\n<p>This Challenge is open to college and graduate students to promote the field of implementation science to the next generation of researchers and offer mentoring and research training. Implementation science is the scientific study of methods and strategies that facilitate the uptake or adoption and integration of evidence-based practices, interventions, programs, policies, and research into regular use by practitioners, health systems, communities, and policymakers. The training and mentoring experiences of the Challenge will enhance SCD research knowledge for students through the creation of Tools for sickle cell disease education. The Challenge is in line with the NHLBI Center for Translation Research and Implementation Science (CTRIS) roadmaps to build capacity and increase awareness of sickle cell disease. This Challenge also encourages “team science” by providing students valuable experiences to pursue science collectively as they engage in complex problem solving to improve outcomes.</p>\n",

Many times, the most important discoveries are completely unexpected – like when a moldy dish left out during vacation leads to the discovery of a vital medicine, penicillin! But, if something is unexpected, how can we prepare for positive and/or negative outcomes? When it comes to understanding the brain, enter: Neuroethics! Careful scientists must consider ethics during their research, including preparing for unanticipated consequences of exciting scientific advances. This challenge is seeking creative essays or videos from currently enrolled U.S. high school students that describe a teen’s perspective on the ethics, limitations, and implications of emerging technology to study and treat disorders of the human brain.</p>\n\n<p>At the National Institutes of Health, the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® (BRAIN) Initiative is funding researchers to revolutionize our understanding of the human brain. Currently, BRAIN Initiative researchers are developing a variety of devices to study the human brain and to treat brain disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, depression, etc. Some of these devices are implanted directly into the brain, while others can operate without needing to physically access the brain. Some of these devices can be used to stimulate activity in specific brain regions for treatment purposes, while others are used to record brain activity. While these devices are opening the doors to new discoveries, they also raise potentially new ethical questions.</p>\n\n<p>The field that studies the ethical, legal, and societal implications of neuroscience is called neuroethics. Below are some neuroethics topics and questions to consider:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Brain data gathered to answer a research question and/or provide clinical benefit:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Who owns the data and who should be able to access it?</li>\n      <li>What information should be shared and what should remain private?</li>\n      <li>How should the data be stored?</li>\n      <li>How should the data be used and for what purposes?</li>\n      <li>Brain data could lead to predictions about human nature. Who is responsible for these predictions and how they are used? For example, how do algorithms consider or use data on age, gender, race or ethnicity to make predictions on human behavior?</li>\n      <li>As brain data is collected, who is it collected from? How does the sampled data generalize to broader populations, and how does that impact the predictions and conclusions inferred from the data?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Special considerations associated with novel brain devices that alter or record brain activity, either implanted or from outside the head:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Who is responsible for the maintenance of brain devices?</li>\n      <li>When data is remotely collected from a brain device, how should we make sure it is collected securely? Is there a security risk?</li>\n      <li>How could brain devices that adjust themselves using artificial intelligence affect a person’s agency or the capacity to act independently and to make their own free choices?</li>\n      <li>What is the appropriate action when an implanted device improves disease symptoms but dramatically changes the individual’s personality?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Informed consent issues, specifically pertaining to studies using novel brain technologies:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Should the informed consent forms be the same for all studies?</li>\n      <li>What is the participant perspective on informed consent? How do participants view the informed consent process and the information they are given?</li>\n      <li>How should informed consent differ for vulnerable populations, like children, pregnant women, and/or those with disabilities or cognitive impairment?</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Translation of new tools and technologies for neuroscience research to contexts beyond the original treatment or research purpose or goals:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Should technologies be used for purposes outside of the original research and/or treatment of health conditions? Where should the limitations be drawn?</li>\n      <li>Should brain technologies be marketed and commercialized like other products? Who should decide what can or cannot be marketed, and by whom?</li>\n      <li>What are the conflicts of interest that should be considered if commercializing brain technologies, particularly for alternate uses? </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Submissions to this challenge are essays and/or videos, submitted via the BRAIN Initiative Challenge campaign of <a href=\"https://ninds.ideascalegov.com/\">https://ninds.ideascalegov.com</a>, that include creative ideas to start a conversation about a neuroethical topic using:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Writing:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Two-page/1000-word essay (max length, excluding references), 11 or 12 point font; Times New Roman, Arial, or Calibri preferred.</li>\n      <li>Essays must be written in English, by a single individual and submitted in.doc, .txt, or .pdf file format.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Or Video:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p>Videos must be no longer than 5 minutes.

The United States BRAIN Initiative includes multiple federal and non-federal groups working together to coordinate these research efforts (<a href=\"https://www.braininitiative.org/\">https://www.braininitiative.org/</a>). By accelerating the development and application of innovative technologies, researchers will be able to produce a revolutionary new dynamic picture of the brain in action. Long desired by researchers seeking new ways to treat, cure, and even prevent brain disorders, this picture will fill major gaps in our current knowledge and provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring exactly how the brain enables us to record, process, utilize, store, and retrieve vast quantities of information, all at the speed of thought.</p>\n\n<p>The National Institutes of Health is the largest funder of biomedical research in the United States (<a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/\">https://www.nih.gov/</a>). It is made up of 27 different components called Institutes and Centers. Each has its own with specific research mission, often focusing on a particular disease or body system. The NIH BRAIN Initiative is a group effort by NIH, managed by the 10 Institutes and Centers whose missions include the study of vision, hearing, neurological disorders, mental health, child health, aging, drug and alcohol abuse, bioengineering, and complementary health.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Launch: Sept 15, 2020</li>\n  <li>Submission Start/End: Oct 1, 2020-Nov 4, 2020</li>\n  <li>Judging Start/End: Nov 2020-Feb 2021</li>\n  <li>Winner Announced: March 2021</li>\n</ul>\n",

Recent <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6919e2.htm\">CDC data</a> show that fewer children got vaccines on time this year compared to last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The P4 Challenge invites applicants to propose and implement <strong>innovative approaches to increase access to and utilization of well-child visits and/or immunizations services within primary care settings.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Innovative approaches in Phase 1 should aim to increase a key pediatric health performance measure such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Number of well-child visits (number of visits/number of children in the target population)</li>\n  <li>Well-child visit disparities (comparing measures across two or more subpopulations)</li>\n  <li>Doses administered of specific vaccines; coverage of the primary pediatric vaccination series (for example, number of MMR vaccines given/number of children 12-18 months in the target population)</li>\n  <li>Disparities within the community on a specific immunization metric (comparing measure across two or more subpopulations)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In Phase 1 of the P4 Challenge, up to 50 applicants will receive $10,000 to deploy the proposed approach in Phase 2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Goal of the P4 Challenge:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The CDC reports that <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6920e1.htm?s_cid=mm6920e1_x\">declines in vaccination coverage</a> might leave young children and communities vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles. Well-child visits also <a href=\"https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/clinical-guidance/guidance-on-providing-pediatric-well-care-during-covid-19/\">declined</a> since the COVID-19 pandemic. These visits are an important venue for counseling, as well as vaccine administration and documentation.</p>\n\n<p>At well-child visits, providers can also screen for developmental delays and parents can raise concerns about a child’s physical problems, behavior and mental health and receive personalized guidance on healthy nutrition, exercise and safety.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to get the message out to parents and caregivers that children should maintain well-child visits and get timely vaccinations in their medical home. Children who are not up-to-date with vaccinations recommended by the CDC’s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recommendations.html\">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)</a> should be seen in primary care as soon as possible for catch-up vaccination.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is encouraged to apply?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) envisions partnerships from various individuals, companies and organizations to meet all of the needs of the challenge. <strong>Please note that submissions must include a primary care provider who delivers health services to children as a key submitter or partner.</strong> MCHB is seeking concept papers from a wide array of contestants and encourages anyone with a good idea and a collaborative team to apply.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>JANUARY 15, 2021 12:00 PM EST</em></strong>: P4 Challenge Informational Webinar. <a href=\"https://capconcorp.zoom.us/j/83746297697?pwd=aE9lT1lpRnVablRuN1czL1BidW1uQT09\">Click here</a> to register.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>JANUARY 19, 2021:</em></strong> Submissions open: visit <a href=\"https://mchb.hrsa.gov/P4Challenge\">agency website</a> for more information on submission requirements, and submit your application to <a href=\"mailto:MCHBP4Challenge@hrsa.gov\">MCHBP4Challenge@hrsa.gov</a></li>\n  <li><strong><em>MARCH 15, 2021:</em></strong> Phase 1 Submissions due</li>\n  <li><strong><em>APRIL 2021:</em></strong> Phase 1 Winners announced, prize money distributed, and Phase 2 begins</li>\n  <li><strong><em>SEPTEMBER 2021:</em></strong> Phase 2 performance results and program progress reports submitted for Phase 2 judging</li>\n  <li><strong><em>OCTOBER 2021:</em></strong> Phase 2 Winners announced</li>\n</ul>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>Challenge Launch planned for October 1, 2020!</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Public Safety Communications Research Division (PSCR) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) invites members of the public to join the Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge. This challenge seeks new tools with which to push the boundaries of current technologies for de-identifying data sets relevant to public safety.</p>\n\n<p>The Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge is a series of contests, with prize awards up to $276,000 for excellence in formal data privacy. The contests will include a metrics development contest in the form of a white paper, a series of algorithm sprints that will explore new methods in differential privacy, and a contest designed to improve the usability of the participants’ source code, open to participants of the algorithm sprints.  There are no fees needed to enter any stage of the Challenge. Teams can participate in either or both the metric contest and the algorithm contest. </p>\n\n<p>You can make a difference!  Continue reading to learn about the challenge contests and other details.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>Large data sets containing personally identifiable information (PII) are exceptionally valuable resources for research and policy analysis in a host of fields such as emergency planning and epidemiology. This project seeks to engage the public in developing algorithms to de-identify data sets containing PII such that the data sets remain valuable tools yet cannot compromise the privacy of individuals whose information is contained within the data set. </p>\n\n<p>Previous NIST PSCR differential privacy projects (<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/past-prize-challenges/2018-differential-privacy-synthetic\">NIST Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/ctl/pscr/open-innovation-prize-challenges/past-prize-challenges/2018-unlinkable-data-challenge\">The Unlinkable Data Challenge: Advancing Methods in Differential Privacy</a>) demonstrated that crowdsourced challenges can make meaningful advancements in this difficult and complex field. Those previous contests raised awareness of the problem, brought in innovators from outside the privacy community, and demonstrated the value of head-to-head competitions for driving progress in data privacy.  This Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge hopes to build on these results by extending the reach and utility of differential privacy algorithms to new data types.</p>\n\n<p>Temporal map data is of particular interest to the public safety community. Yet the ability to track a person’s location over a period of time presents particularly serious privacy concerns. The Differential Privacy Temporal Map Challenge invites participants to develop algorithms that preserve data utility while guaranteeing privacy.</p>\n\n<p>Differential privacy is a standard that protects privacy no matter what third-party data is available.  It does so by strictly limiting what is possible to learn about any individual in the data set.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Project Objectives</strong></p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this Challenge is to advance differential privacy technologies by building and measuring accuracy of algorithms that de-identify data sets containing time and spatial information with provable formal privacy. Public safety agencies collect extensive data containing time, geographic, and potentially personally identifiable information. These data can be an invaluable tool for policy makers, researchers, and the public in general. However, the tools do not yet exist to de-identify these data sets and preserve their utility while guaranteeing the records cannot be used to re-link to individuals. Thus, PSCR is inviting the public to explore new computational methods to de-identify these data sets and assess the quality of the output data. Some of the key features and capabilities for de-identification algorithms sought in this challenge include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Output data that satisfies formal differential privacy.</li>\n  <li>Preserving the characteristics of original data sets as much as possible and, in particular, preserving sequential data characteristics and geographic characteristics.</li>\n  <li>Robust in their ability to process a wide variety of temporal and spatial data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NIST PSCR also invites participants to develop metrics that best assess the accuracy of the data output by the algorithms that de-identify temporal map data. In particular, methods are sought that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Measure the quality of data with respect to temporal or spatial accuracy, or both. </li>\n  <li>Evaluate data quality in situations beyond this challenge.</li>\n  <li>Are straightforward to implement.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NIST PSCR seeks to incentivize participants to develop their algorithms into tools useful to public safety agencies and to be of benefit to public safety in general. To that end, NIST PSCR will consider solutions that are made open and accessible to the public for an Open Source Award. In the interest of refining and improving usability of the algorithms, NIST PSCR will invite algorithm participants to create a Development Plan that describes how participants will improve their code and make it more usable.

Of the challenge teams, 26% were comprised of students from HBCUs and 16% of the teams attend HSIs.</p>\n\n<p>“With 94% of the competitors attending colleges and universities outside of California, this challenge served as an avenue to make broader impacts in STEM,” said Yolanda Tanner, Naval Information Warfare Systems Command (NAVWAR) STEM Federal Action Officer and NIWC Pacific Internship and Fellowship project manager. “It was also a means by which students could further develop their STEM skills while working collaboratively to solve a real-world naval problem.”</p>\n\n<p>Florida, North Carolina, and Texas had the largest population of participating collegiate teams.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n\n<p>The Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific and the Naval Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Coordination Office, managed by the Office of Naval Research are conducting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tracks at Sea challenge.  The goal of this challenge is to engage with the workforce of tomorrow on challenging and relevant naval problems.  The need here is to augment unmanned surface vehicles’ (USVs’) maritime contact tracking capability.  Current traffic avoidance software relies on AIS and radar for tracking other craft and avoiding collisions.  However, in a contested environment, emitting radar energy presents a vulnerability to detection by adversaries.  Deactivating RF transmitting sources mitigates the threat of detection, but without additional sensing and sensor fusion, it would also degrade the USV’s ability to monitor shipping traffic in its vicinity.  The technology developed for this prize challenge will solve this problem by developing a computer vision system that will plot the tracks of shipping traffic exclusively using the passive sensing capability of onboard cameras.  This technology would also be applicable for the Navy to document vessels performing unsafe navigation on the high seas.</p>\n",

The prize competition will also recognize the most impactful ideas for using prize funds to develop strong connections and support within the research and development (R&amp;D) innovation ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>The R&amp;D innovation ecosystem describes the complex community of participants and resources needed to develop and commercialize technology. This ecosystem includes the people (students, faculty, industry researchers, investors, et al) that make up the institutional entities (universities, businesses, funding agencies, venture capital firms, state and local economic development organizations, entrepreneur support organizations, etc.), material resources (funding, equipment, facilities, etc.), and the relationships among these interconnected actors. These ecosystems may operate at different geographic levels (e.g. city, regional, national) and within multiple sectors (e.g. health, energy, agriculture).</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurs may lack knowledge about available ecosystem resources or have difficulty navigating and finding them, posing significant barriers to entry, and keeping the best minds and ideas from reaching their full potential. Additionally, resources and capital are not reaching all Americans evenly, and the economic impacts of COVID-19 could increase this inequality.</p>\n\n<p>Connectivity and coordination across R&amp;D innovation ecosystems is even more critical today to support recovery from potential COVID-19 impacts on high growth startups.</p>\n\n<p>Ensuring that access to resources and capital are available to all Americans is essential in creating a robust and dynamic workforce with inclusive growth, and ensuring the benefits of entrepreneurship accrue across the nation.</p>\n\n<p>The goals of this competition are:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>to highlight successful examples of R&amp;D innovation ecosystems, particularly those that include underrepresented communities;</li>\n  <li>to surface the most innovative practices or solutions to mitigate secondary impacts of COVID-19 on high growth startups; and</li>\n  <li>to enhance the connection and integration of Federal resources that support innovation ecosystems.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Informational Webinar: 09/25/2020 12:00 PM ET\nRegister at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/l2mPrizeWebinar\">http://bit.ly/l2mPrizeWebinar</a></p>\n",

The xTech SBIR D2PhII Technology event will provide a forum for small businesses to collaborate with the Army, earn prize money, and engage with other non-traditional Army partners. Winners of the xTech SBIR D2PhII Technology event will be invited to submit a D2PhII SBIR proposal to prototype their proposed technology innovations. Prize money will be awarded to selected projects through the Army xTech program and D2PhII SBIR awards will be available through the Army SBIR program.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the xTech SBIR D2PhII pilot is to accelerate technology prototypes for crucial Army capability gaps into military platform. Submissions will be open to technology solutions that may considerably improve Army platforms, Army weapons systems, or Army support systems in one of the six (6) topic areas listed below.</p>\n\n<p>The prize challenge will be used to identify small business concerns that meet the criteria for award of a D2PhII contract under 15 U.S.C. §638. Winners of the prize competition will be the only firms eligible to submit a D2PhII SBIR proposal under the topics listed in this announcement. A separate SBIR D2PhII announcement will be issued concurrent with this prize competition announcement.</p>\n\n<p>The proposed schedule for this challenge is:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/xtech-sbir.png\" alt=\"Challenge Schedule\" title=\"Challenge Schedule\" /></p>\n\n<p>Submissions that do not address the problem statements below will not be considered for this effort. The efforts described in this Notice are being pursued under the authorities of 10 USC 2374a, 10 USC 2371b, and 15 USC 638. All participants must qualify as a US-based small business concern as defined by 13 C.F.R §§ 701-705 and certify to this upon technology proposal submission. Participants must meet eligibility requirements for Small Business Ownership and Control (see 13 CFR § 121.702). Submissions that do not address the problem statements below or submitted from non U.S.-based companies or organizations will not be considered for the prize competition.</p>\n\n<p>(For full problem descriptions, please visit the application page or download the “xTech SBIR Topics” document below)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic A:</strong> Combat Vehicle Modernization – Advanced hybrid networks and cable management strategies</p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement A: This topic seeks novel concepts for reducing cabling requirements within ground combat vehicles, while minimizing the electronic signature footprint, maintaining or improving data throughput rates/capacities, and improving physical characteristics, such as size and weight. Potential solutions may include one or more transmission mediums.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic B:</strong> Autonomous Navigation Sensor Technologies</p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement B: Demonstrate the ability to employ effective passive sensor technologies and associated algorithms and techniques to augment semi-(operator assist capabilities) and fully-autonomous off-road navigation systems for Army Ground Combat Vehicles in Degraded Visual Environments (DVE). The focus of this topic is to augment existing and planned Army autonomous navigation investments and infrastructure (e.g. sensors, data collection, simulation, etc.) leading to improved navigational performance, new capabilities, or SWAP-C (size, weight, power, and cost) reductions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic C:</strong> Advanced Real Time Global High-Resolution Environmental Information to Support Multi-Domain Operations</p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement C: Advanced Real Time Global High-Resolution Environmental Information to Support Multi-Domain Operations for the development and demonstration of a capability that addresses requirements crossing multiple program executive office and program management. The desired end product of Phase II is to have one or more technically feasible technologies operating as functional prototype(s) during DoD-sanctioned exercises in order to provide operational testing and data collection on the cyber security, usability and effectiveness of prototype(s).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic D</strong>: Ultra Narrow-band Emergency Radio</p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement D: The Army seeks a radio capability that will enable large numbers of vehicles and soldiers to communicate at extremely low data rates, and with low probability of being detected or geolocated by adversaries. The Army of the future requires mission assured communications that will provide anti-jam “Interference Tolerant Wireless Communications” - addressing C3I capability and advanced expeditionary electronic countermeasures (ECM). The communications must deliver a unique undetectable communication channel which overcomes the difficulties in managing interference. The solution must deliver a frequency-agile communication technology that is effective when operating in harsh radio environments containing significant amounts of interference.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic E</strong>: Non-Lethal Vehicle Defense System</p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement E: Army manned and unmanned vehicles must be able to perform their missions in scenarios where they must operate among local populations. The local populations can pose a potential threat to operations, but lethal response measures may not be appropriate. The Army seeks non-lethal solutions that will inhibit or discourage civilians and bystanders from interfering with operations of manned and unmanned platforms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic F</strong>: Condition-Based Maintenance for Combat Vehicles</p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement F: Demonstrate the ability to employ technologies and associated algorithms and techniques via new or existing sensors and telematics to create advanced prognostics and diagnostics methodologies for future and current Army vehicles. The focus of this topic is to anticipate component failures and reduce the amount of unplanned maintenance resulting is increased readiness of the fleet.</p>\n",

The Department invites eligible providers to design pre-apprenticeship programs that better prepare learners for apprenticeships and to succeed in their chosen professions.</p>\n\n<p>Apprenticeships serve as an important pathway to well-paying careers across a range of industries, such as manufacturing, construction, technology, and healthcare. However, many adults miss out on these opportunities because they are not aware of apprenticeship programs or do not have the necessary skills to prepare for or gain entry to them.</p>\n\n<p>Pre-apprenticeships bridge this gap by equipping people with the skills and knowledge they need to gain entry to, and succeed in, apprenticeships. Pre-apprenticeship program participants learn academic skills, time management skills, technology skills, and conflict management skills. Participants may also learn industry-specific skills, such as how to use relevant tools and machinery. Programs may also include distance learning and artificial intelligence, so they may go to scale and serve a larger population of students.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge aims to spur the creation of new pre-apprenticeship programs and increase the capacity of adult education providers to deliver high-quality programs. The Challenge will be conducted in two stages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Stage 1 Open submissions (September 24, 2020 - November 25, 2020)</p>\n\n    <p>During Stage 1, eligible providers will enter the Challenge by completing a Stage 1 submission (a Preliminary Design) on the Challenge website.

            "description": "<p>The FAA is sponsoring the <strong>FAA Challenge: Smart Airport Student Competition</strong> (“Smart Airport Challenge”) to recognize students with the ability to demonstrate innovative thinking focused on improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and utilization of smart technology in and around the airport environment while enhancing the overall traveling experience.</p>\n\n<p>The FAA is using this competition to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>stimulate and advance innovation in aviation research;</li>\n  <li>promote the development of a robust aviation workforce to support a growing and evolving aerospace system;</li>\n  <li>develop a pipeline to fill current and projected shortages via partnerships with academia and industry;</li>\n  <li>and drive a passion for aviation in today’s youth of all ages and backgrounds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The FAA intends to incentivize university-level students at accredited United States-based colleges and universities to think creatively in developing solutions to transportation technology challenges while addressing the human factors aspects of the traveler’s experience, and to share those innovations with the broader community.</p>\n\n<p>Universities should consider the cutting-edge needs of the FAA and smart airports of the future, focusing on key emerging technology areas of health-smart airports, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), data analytics, and autonomous robotics systems. Teams should propose one (1) of the four (4) following themes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 1: Increased Sanitation and Hygiene Practices for Health-Smart Airports</strong>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused public concern regarding air travel due to potential spread of the virus through human contact, surfaces, and air particles. Smart airports of the future should be designed to reduce the spread of pathogens. Innovative solutions are sought for integrating health screening into the security process, reducing the need for physical contact or proximity with passengers through automation, increasing monitoring of social distancing and symptomatic individuals, improving air circulation and filtering, and improving sanitation practices, including the use of UV light.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 2: Innovative Uses for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) at Airports</strong>\nThe use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has increased exponentially over the past decade. Smart airports of the future could safely use UAS in a variety of functions. Innovative solutions are sought for the use of tethered or untethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), or “drones,” for UAV/wildlife detection and mitigation, detection of foreign objects or ice on runways/taxiways, aircraft and runway inspection, perimeter security, and increased connectivity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 3: Smart Airport Data Analytics</strong>\nData analytics is an emerging field of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions and is being used nationwide to discover and predict trends. Airports are complex systems rich in data that could be used to improve operations, passenger experience, and safety. Innovative solutions are sought for the use of big data analytic techniques to reduce security wait times, facilitate navigation, increase the probability of on-time departures, reduce energy consumption, automate interpretation of video data, and improve operational efficiency.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Theme 4: Innovative Uses for Autonomous Robotics Systems at Airports</strong>\nAutonomous and semi-autonomous robotics systems are being used throughout industry to improve productivity and perform potentially hazardous operations. High levels of reliability and trusted autonomy are required for such systems to be integrated into airport operations. Innovative reliable autonomous systems are sought for security screening, mobility of passengers and equipment, baggage handling and transport, baggage inspection and tracking, UAV/wildlife detection and mitigation, perimeter security, and runway incursion detection.</p>\n\n<p>Please carefully review the FAA Challenge website <a href=\"http://faachallenge.nianet.org\">http://faachallenge.nianet.org</a> for updated competition details.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates:</h4>\n\n<p><em>Submissions:</em> The FAA Challenge competition will accept submissions between 12:00 PM ET October 15, 2020 and 11:59 PM ET February 4, 2021.</p>\n\n<p><em>Expression of Interest:</em> Teams are encouraged to submit an Expression of Interest to compete in this FAA Challenge by 11:59 PM ET November 12, 2020.</p>\n\n<p><em>Finalist Announcement:</em> A panel of FAA judges will conduct an evaluation and select three finalist teams, which will be announced in early March 2021.</p>\n\n<p><em>Demonstration and Awards:</em> Finalist teams will be invited to the FAA Challenge Forum to demonstrate their concepts in late June 2021.

OWH establishes short and long-term goals within the Department for research, disease prevention and health promotion, service delivery, and education for public health and health care professionals surrounding women and girls’ health. OWH identifies needs and monitors activities within the Department that contribute to women and girls’ health and through leadership of the Coordinating Committee on Women’s Health. Additionally, OWH is responsible for facilitating the exchange of information through the National Women’s Health Information Center and promoting women and girls’ health programs and policies, all aimed at improving the health of women and girls.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr60/nvsr60_03.pdf\">leading cause of death for women</a> in the United States. Hypertension <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/pregnancy.htm\">affects one in every twelve to seventeen pregnancies</a> in the United States. Women with hypertension are at risk for developing preeclampsia, stroke, and other serious complications in pregnancy and/or postpartum. Factors which increase the risk of hypertension during pregnancy include obesity and maternal age. Factors which limit women’s ability to manage their blood pressure include cost, transportation, schedules, locality (living in rural or underserved areas), and lack of education about the importance of good blood pressure control.</p>\n\n<p>Innovative programs can overcome these challenges to increase the number of Americans with good blood pressure control and improve the nation’s health. Some progress has been made with home blood pressure monitoring, text-based communications with health care teams, revised prenatal and postpartum visit schedules, new models of patient education and empowerment, and partnerships with different members of the health care team and community.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>OWH is creating a national competition to identify effective, pre-existing programs that care for people with hypertension where the programs could be or are already applied to women with hypertension who are pregnant and/or postpartum. The goal of this innovative competition is to demonstrate sustainability and the ability to replicate and/or expand a program that provides effective monitoring and follow-up of hypertension for women who are pregnant and/or postpartum.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>This program will include attention to disparities, including racial/ethnic and/or urban/rural. The program must demonstrate evidence-based approaches to screening and treating hypertensive disorders and will be shared with the general public.</p>\n\n<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Identification of successful programs</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Open September 30, 2020 through January 6, 2021.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Tuesday, October 20, 2020, 3:00-4:00 pm EST</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>View recording <a href=\"https://hhs.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/hhs/recording/playback/d9877da6ce0546e78af530a9053ed80d\">here</a>; Password: HypertensionWebinar1</li>\n      <li>View PowerPoint Slides (pdf) <a href=\"https://files.womenshealth.gov/files/oash-owh-htn-challenge_508.pdf\">here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Friday, October 30, 2020, 3:00-4:00 pm EST</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>View PowerPoint Slides (pdf) <a href=\"https://files.womenshealth.gov/files/oash-owh-htn-challenge_508.pdf\">here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Friday, November 6, 2020, 3:00-4:00 pm EST</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>View recording <a href=\"https://hhs.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/hhs/recording/playback/fe5a45bfee4e4c42a4f815437568e338\">here</a>; Password: HypertensionWebinar3</li>\n      <li>View PowerPoint Slides (pdf) <a href=\"https://files.womenshealth.gov/files/oash-owh-htn-challenge_508.pdf\">here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Webinar: Monday, November 23, 2020, 1:00-2:00 pm EST</li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Webinar: Wednesday, December 16, 2020, 2:00-3:00 pm EST; Join<a href=\"https://hhs.webex.com/hhs/j.php?MTID=m477f7cdec5edbf530757d84167d1c0f0\"> here</a></strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Meeting number (access code): 199 719 9629</li>\n      <li>Meeting password: GraADfqM259</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Phase 1 submissions are due by January 6, 2021, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Judging for Phase 1 will occur from January 7, 2021 through January 14, 2021.</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: July 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Awarding plans for sustainability and replication and/or expansion</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins: September 29, 2021.</li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: January 5, 2022, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: February 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> Awarding the programs that have successfully replicated and/or expanded</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins: September 29, 2022.</li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: January 5, 2023, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: February 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n",

            "description": "<p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition to strengthen the Direct Support Professional (DSP) workforce and overall stability of home and community based services (HCBS) for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (ID/DD).  To achieve this, the <em>Blazing New Trails for Community Based Direct Support Professionals</em> challenge seeks to engage the marketplace to innovate, pilot, and expand innovations that will transform the DSP workforce.</p>\n\n<p>When Americans with disabilities live independently, fully included in communities across our Nation – with the right supports in place – they are happier and healthier. Often, DSPs have a critical role to sustaining the independence of individuals with ID/DD. DSPs support individuals in making informed decisions, understanding risk, exercising their rights and choosing personal care support which facilitate the ability of individuals with ID/DD to pursue their individualized pathways to fully participate in the life of communities where we live.</p>\n\n<p>The DSP workforce is one of the highest in demand. It is anticipated that the demand will continue to grow and outpace supply as more individuals with ID/DD live in the community and live longer. Yet, with an average turnover rate of 45 percent, there is a perpetual imbalance in supply and demand that will only worsen with time. It is estimated that with the current turnover rates, <a href=\"https://ici.umn.edu/program-areas/community-living-and-employment/direct-support-workforce\">574,200 new DSPs need to enter the workforce</a> annually to sustain current services levels. Extending services to the approximately 200,000 people with ID/DD on waiting lists would require an additional 167,001 new DSPs to enter the workforce. Unless addressed, this imbalance will continue well into the future and will significantly impact the quality of life of people with ID/DD living in the community.  To learn more please review the <a href=\"https://cqrcengage.com/ancor/file/ZuL1zlyZ3mE/Workforce%20White%20Paper%20-%20Final%20-%20hyperlinked%20version.pdf\">2017 Report</a> from American Network of Community Options and Resources, “Addressing the Disability Services Workforce Crisis of the 21st Century.”</p>\n\n<p>There are multiple drivers behind a perpetual and growing demand that outpaces supply. The <a href=\"https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/programs/2018-02/2017%20PCPID%20Full%20Report_0.PDF\">2017 Report</a> of the President’s Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities identifies the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Growth in the number of people with ID/DD who need and receive services,</li>\n  <li>Major shifts in the type of services desired and delivered to people with ID/DD,</li>\n  <li>Steadily increasing longevity of people with ID/ DD,</li>\n  <li>Changing U.S. population demographics,</li>\n  <li>Changes in the overall U.S. labor force and economy and,</li>\n  <li>The failure to create an occupation of direct support with sufficient pay, benefits, training, career trajectories and status to recruit and retain a stable, skilled workforce.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>ACL is looking for innovative ideas that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Create a better balance of the supply and demand of qualified DSP’s</li>\n  <li>Achieve better rates of retention through incentives, advancement, career paths, etc.</li>\n  <li>Factor in and address any real and measurable barriers such as geographic (e.g., rural vs urban, etc.), transportation, and training.</li>\n  <li>Redefine career development requirements and pathways using non-traditional methods.</li>\n  <li>Include individuals from the ID/DD community throughout the development and testing of models.</li>\n  <li>Include a business commitment to implement the model for Round 2 (small scale testing) of the challenge.</li>\n  <li>Lead to improved stability of the HCBS system and outcomes for individuals with ID/DD.</li>\n  <li>Provide a more innovative business model than the current standard.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To better balance the supply of qualified DSPs with the demand, innovations are needed that will stabilize the DSP workforce and overall quality of HCBS. This prize competition will support the rapid innovation and adoption of business models that that will better meet market demand, including any factors unique to specific markets, such as geographic location (e.g., be urban, suburban or rural). To bring supply and demand closer together, ACL seeks new approaches that will disrupt current business models which has been driving much of the industry.</p>\n\n<p>The challenge will be completed in three rounds:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Round 1</strong>, beginning in Fall of 2020, ACL will seek proposals from competitors who aim to create innovative models that will improve the stability of the DSP workforce supporting individuals with ID/DD living in the community.</li>\n  <li><strong>Round 2</strong>, beginning in Spring of 2021, participants will be asked to conduct small scale feasibility testing on the selected models. Teams will convene in Washington, D.C. or remotely to propose their ideas to a panel of judges who will help select winners. Judges will have expertise in the DSP labor market, economics, and lived experience with ID/DD.</li>\n  <li><strong>Round 3</strong>, beginning in Summer 2021, will examine the long-term sustainability of the models and the Grand Prize winner will be announced in October of 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n",
            "prizes": "<h4 id=\"prize-breakdown\">Prize Breakdown</h4>\n\n<p>The total prize purse of $310,000 will be executed in three rounds. Each round will offer cash prizes to awardees. Funds will be awarded as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Round 1</strong> – Proposal of Innovative Models: HHS will make up to five (5) awards for a total of $100,000.</li>\n  <li><strong>Round 2</strong> – Small Scale Testing of Models: HHS will make up to three (3) awards for a total of $90,000.</li>\n  <li><strong>Round 3</strong> – Promise of Model Sustainability: HHS will make one (1) award of $120,000</li>\n</ul>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>***Important Update:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>*** Due to the overwhelming interest and submissions for the “Reducing Disparities in Breastfeeding Innovation Challenge,” we are delaying the announcement of Phase 1 winners until July 2021. ***</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is seeking innovative ways to increase breastfeeding initiation and/or continuation rates and decrease disparities among breastfeeding mothers in the United States through the HHS Reducing Disparities in Breastfeeding Innovation Challenge.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"backgroundissue\">Background/Issue</h4>\n\n<p>The HHS Office on Women’s Health (OWH) is charged with providing expert advice and consultation to the Secretary on scientific, legal, ethical, and policy issues, and serving as a coordination point throughout HHS on issues affecting the health of women and girls. OWH establishes short and long-term goals within the Department for research, disease prevention and health promotion, service delivery, and education for public health and health care professionals surrounding women and girls’ health. OWH identifies needs and monitors activities within the Department that contribute to women and girls’ health and through leadership of the Coordinating Committee on Women’s Health. Additionally, OWH is responsible for facilitating the exchange of information through the National Women’s Health Information Center and promoting women and girls’ health programs and policies, all aimed at improving the health of women and girls.</p>\n\n<p>Breastfeeding is good for mothers and babies. Breast milk provides the necessary nutrition for infants, changing over time to meet infants’ changing nutritional needs. Breastfeeding can reduce the risk of short- and long-term illnesses and diseases in both mother and baby. The <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/3/e827\">American Academy of Pediatrics recommends</a> “exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months with continued breastfeeding with complementary foods for one year or longer as mutually desired by mother and infant.” Research also suggests that <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2752994\">breastfeeding may reduce a mother’s risk</a> of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.  Furthermore, studies suggest that interventions focusing on the prevention of diabetes and hypertension through education about breastfeeding benefits may have a positive impact on mothers’ cardiovascular outcomes.  Despite the many benefits of breastfeeding, racial and ethnic disparities exist among women initiating and continuing breastfeeding.</p>\n\n<p>African American mothers have persistently had the lowest rate of breastfeeding initiation and duration.  The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK52682/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK52682.pdf\">2011 Surgeon General’s Call to Action to Support Breastfeeding</a> noted that breastfeeding rates for black infants are lower than for white infants at all measurement periods after controlling for family income and education level.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>OWH is creating a national competition to identify effective, pre-existing programs that increase breastfeeding initiation and continuation rates and decrease disparities among breastfeeding mothers in the United States. The goal of this innovative competition is to demonstrate sustainability and the ability to replicate and/or expand a program that has proven outcomes to improve breastfeeding rates and reduce disparities.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>The program must demonstrate evidence-based interventions to target gaps in breastfeeding education, instruction, and/or support for breastfeeding mothers in the United States.  The program will be shared with the general public.</p>\n\n<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Identification of successful programs</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins: September 30, 2020</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Wednesday, October 21, 2020, 3:00-4:00 pm EST.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>View recording <a href=\"https://hhs.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/hhs/recording/playback/c230cb0c01c54838b5322de28c256de3\">here</a>; Password: BreastfeedingWebinar1</li>\n      <li>View PowerPoint Slides (pdf) <a href=\"https://files.womenshealth.gov/files/breastfeeding-innovation-challenge-phase-1-webinar-fink_508.pdf\">here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Friday, October 30, 2020, 2:00-3:00 pm EST.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>View PowerPoint Slides (pdf) <a href=\"https://files.womenshealth.gov/files/breastfeeding-innovation-challenge-phase-1-webinar-fink_508.pdf\">here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Friday, November 6, 2020, 2:00-3:00 pm EST.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>View recording <a href=\"https://hhs.webex.com/recordingservice/sites/hhs/recording/playback/9e12d82641a14122a0156c95050ae4da\">here</a>; Password: BreastfeedingWebinar3</li>\n      <li>View PowerPoint Slides (pdf) <a href=\"https://files.womenshealth.gov/files/breastfeeding-innovation-challenge-phase-1-webinar-fink_508.pdf\">here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Webinar: Monday, November 23, 2020, 2:00-3:00 pm EST; Join <a href=\"https://hhs.webex.com/webappng/sites/hhs/meeting/download/22b4f18949df4f81a9f073ff40b15d5c?siteurl=hhs&amp;MTID=ma767d7249b4de76d79977b706c880a53\">here</a></li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: December 9, 2020, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: July 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Awarding plans for sustainability and replication and/or expansion</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins September 29, 2021.</li>\n  <li>Submission period ends:  December 8, 2021, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: February 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Awarding the programs that have successfully replicated and/or expanded</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins September 29, 2022.</li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: December 7, 2022, 11:59 pm EST.</li>\n  <li>Winners announced February 2023.</li>\n</ul>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>PROBLEM STATEMENT</strong>\nNavy sailors conducting operational tasking for capturing Fleet Visual Information (Fleet VI) need a standalone solution that can quickly and effectively capture broadcast-quality interactions between US Naval vessels and adversarial units violating internationally recognized seafaring protocols to chronologically report these incidents to Combatant Commanders, the Secretary of Defense, and the American public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>\nOperational Task Visual Information (OPTASK VI) is a coordinated Navy-wide operational tasking message that defines the Navy requirements and procedures for the collection and dissemination of Fleet VI. Its purpose is to win the battle of the narrative of unsafe and unprofessional interactions by foreign militaries against our maritime vessels. To be first with the truth, video and still photos of these incidents must be recorded to show the whole story. Visually presenting the facts and the context of the encounters brings the Navy one step closer to winning the battle of the narrative. However, the content and context are not enough, timely release of Fleet VI is essential for presenting the facts before a false narrative takes hold. OPTASK VI sets a 40-minute goal for transmitting Fleet VI to the appropriate maritime operations center and/or fleet command at the end of an event. Nevertheless, a broadcast-quality product at one hour is better than a poor product at 40 minutes. Content, context, and time together are ingredients needed to win the battle of the narrative.</p>\n\n<p>To effectively integrate content, context, and timing, Fleet VI teams need to be trained to capture and transmit still photos with full-motion and high definition videos at sea anytime day or night. Some of the training includes capturing video clips that do not exceed 60-seconds in length; these video clips help tell the story of the event. They must maintain consistent point-of-view and field-of-view with both ships in frame. Video clips should also be sent with at least one photo of the event that can further help detail the story. For example, a wide perspective shot that contains visual adversarial ship markers such as flags, vessel hull numbers, and personnel. The ability to capture such video clips and photos minimizes adversary’s ability to produce a false narrative.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Current Solution</strong>\nFleet VI teams understand the importance of winning the battle of the narrative for unsafe and unprofessional interactions by foreign militaries against our maritime vessels. The current standard operating procedures vary from vessel to vessel; however, effectively integrating content, context, and timing remain a high priority. One example, when a VI event is announced by the commanding officer of the vessel, sailors must hastily assume his/her immediate new role. Switching roles is just one impediment Fleet VI teams face. Other difficulties include maneuvering around several obstacles on the ship with various handheld cameras and/or recording devices to achieve the best footage possible. Once the raw footage is captured, Fleet VI teams must aggregate the footage from many storage devices and engage with multiple shipboard personnel to collect additional data. For example, multiple sensors, bridge-to-bridge communications, ships current location, range, heading and bearing, all of which are potentially important in accurately portraying the story. Lastly, the data must be organized and stored for easy retrieval.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ideal Solution</strong>\nEven the best trained Fleet VI teams and the most well thought-out standard operating procedures can fall short of effectively and efficiently capturing Fleet VI events. Fleet VI teams need innovative solutions that reliably capture broadcast-quality footage for Combatant Commanders, the Secretary of Defense, and the American public. An ideal solution, as defined by the Navy, would be one that maintains continuous high-definition, wide-angle field-of-view, and point-of-view footage around US Navy vessels in various environmental conditions. Therefore, the Fleet VI Challenge is looking for Submitters as identified in the eligibility, that have Hardware Solutions that are either currently available or will soon (less than 2-years) be available to the private sector and require little to no modification for the Navy’s relevant environment. A Hardware Solution as defined by the Navy as suitable for Fleet VI is as follows: A reliable, scalable, and user-friendly architecture that has multiple Sensors that interface together at a central video management system. This interface may be wireless, hardwired, or a combination of the two; however, it MUST maintain reliable connectivity to a central video management system for maintaining a constant state of continuous recording of VI events. Sensors, as defined by the Navy, must capture, and record high definition quality video and photos of sea interactions between vessels while maintaining a wide field-of-view and a reference point-of-view given various environmental conditions. These clear high definition videos and photos must be managed by a central video management system that may or may not have software/firmware embedded; however, this management system must be reliable, scalable, ruggedized, user-friendly, and capable of organizing captured footage. It must also contain storage capacity either internally or externally that allows sailors the capability to access stored footage at a future date.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/submitter_hardware_interface.jpg\" alt=\"Submitter Hardware Interface\" title=\"Submitter Hardware Interface\" /></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Registration and Submissions Opens:  <strong>October 13, 2020</strong></li>\n  <li>Challenge Registration Deadline: <strong>January 11, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Full proposal/Quad-chart &amp; Opt.

            "judging": "<p><strong>Evaluation Committee Evaluators Responsibilities (ECE):</strong> ECE are members who will evaluate submitters and serve as judges for the Challenge and are voting members of the EC. They are responsible for determining how well proposals and demonstrations satisfy the evaluation criteria. ECE will be made up of senior level personnel and operators who have operations experience on Fleet VI.</p>\n\n<p><strong>EC Selection Consultants (SC) Responsibilities:</strong> The SC will provide consultation on the execution of the prize Challenge. They have vast experience in OPTASK VI requirements for the Department of the Navy. They are also the immediate stakeholders who have provided extensive support and guidance on how the prize Challenge shall be executed. It must be noted that members of the SC are non-voting members; however, their input will be considered in the final selection of the prize Challenge winners.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"judging-criteria\">Judging Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>This Challenge will use a normalized weighted metric approach. All Hardware Solution requirements were identified by Fleet VI SME. Each requirement is correlated to multiple measurable technical attributes that have been identified by EC members. Customer Requirements, Requirements Relative Weight, Technical Attributes, Customer Importance value, and Attribute Relative Weight, together form a correlation matrix. This type of correlation matrix is referred to as a level-one Quality Function Deployment (QFD). A QFD identifies the voice of the customer. EC members will use a level-one QFD to understand numerically the Technical Attribute Relative Weight.</p>\n\n<p>The figure below identifies the customer requirements (highlighted in blue) and how important the customer views that specific requirement. The Customer Importance (highlighted yellow) is on a scale measured from zero to five. A Customer Importance of zero would indicate that the requirement is not important at all, while a Customer Importance of five would indicate that the requirement is of the highest importance. Given this information, EC members can calculate the Requirements Relative Weight of each requirement (highlighted white) using the equation below. The relative weight of each requirement will be used to calculate the Attribute Relative Weight.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/requirement_weight_equation.jpg\" alt=\"Requirement Relative Weight Equation\" title=\"Requirement Relative Weight Equation\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Requirement, Requirement Relative Weight, and Customer Importance Image</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/requirements.jpg\" alt=\"Requirement, Requirement Relative Weight, and Customer Importance Image\" title=\"Requirement, Requirement Relative Weight, and Customer Importance Image\" /></p>\n\n<p>The Customer Requirements, identified in the figure above, alone are ambiguous; therefore, Technical Attributes that make the Customer Requirements possible must be identified. For example, if my Customer Requirement is “Capable of HD Data Capture”, then one attribute could be the “Resolution of Footage”. The understanding of the correlation between a Customer Requirement and a measurable Attribute is critical for a level-one QFD. After all possible Technical Attributes are listed, a Relationship Value is given for each Attribute that correlates to the Customer Requirements. A Relationship Value of 1, 3, or 9 will be given. A Relationship Value of one would indicate a weak correlation, while a value of nine would indicate the strongest correlation. Symbols were used for wide view of correlations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Relationship Values</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/relationship_values.png\" alt=\"Relationship Values\" title=\"Relationship Values\" /></p>\n\n<p>The figure below identifies the column titled “Resolution Footage”, which is one of 60 Attributes (refer to stages # 2, # 3, # 5 for list of Attributes) that will be used for grading during the Challenge. The Importance Rating Sum (highlighted yellow) is the sum-product of the correlated Attributes column and the Requirements Relative Weight row. EC members can calculate the Attribute Relative Weight of each requirement (highlighted in blue) using the equation below. These 60 relative weighted percentages will be used in the final scoring for each submitter. The sum-product of all the individual scores will result in an overall final percentage.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/attribute_weight_equation-1-.jpg\" alt=\"Attribute Weight Equation\" title=\"Attribute Weight Equation\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Attribute Relative Weight</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/attribute_relative_weight.jpg\" alt=\"Attribute Relative Weight\" title=\"Attribute Relative Weight\" /></p>\n\n<p>A level-one QFD is not enough to carefully select a winner to the Challenge. This is because a QFD is intended to identify what technical attributes can be reduced or eliminated in a design phase of a new system while still maintaining the voice of the customer. This Challenge does not intend to seek out a submitter to develop from scratch a Hardware Solution. It intends to seek a submitter who already has a Hardware Solution that best aligns with Fleet VI requirements that may or may not require slight modifications for the Navy’s environment. Therefore, a minimum baseline on each measurable Attribute identified will be added to the QFD. Each ECE will grade each submitter’s Hardware Solution attributes on how it measures up to the minimum baseline. The grading values are does not meet baseline (3pts), meets baseline = (5 pts), slightly exceeds baseline (7 pts), and exceeds the baseline (9 pts).  These grading values will each be multiplied by their respective Attribute Relative Weight percentages. The sum-product of all the individual scores will render an overall final percentage score. See example and image below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Example: (refer to image below)</strong>\nResolution Footage Baseline = 1080P\nResolution Footage Baseline points (Meets Baseline) = 5\nResolution Footage Attribute Relative Weight = 3.54% (Highlighted blue)</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Each competitor will be given a score of either 3, 5, 7, or 9 based on the performance of the resolution attribute</li>\n  <li>Arbitrary numbers have been entered in the Resolution Footage column for each competitor for this example.</li>\n  <li>If this Attribute was the sole measure of the Challenge winner, then competitor #6 would be the winner at 3.808% (highlighted green)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Resolution Footage Example</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/resolution_footage_example.jpg\" alt=\"Resolution Footage Example\" title=\"Resolution Footage Example\" /></p>\n",

In these ten minutes the submitter has the freedom to elaborate on information in the quad-chart or full proposal; however, the quad-chart must be used. Please provide a hyperlink to your optional video presentations in an email with the subject line “COMPANYNAME_PRESENTATION_VIDEO” to Submission Emails.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage #3: Review/Competitor Selection</strong></p>\n\n<p>During this stage, the EC will convene for a complete evaluation of each registered submitter. There is no needed information from the registered submitters during this stage. The MAXIMUM number of registered submitters that will be proceeding to stages #4, #5, #6 will be six. The competition may have less than six submitters but not less than two. If less than two than further review of the submitter’s information will be conducted to get to the minimum number of competitors. All submitters will be graded on their submitted information and how it correlates to the list below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Resolution</li>\n  <li>Frame stabilization</li>\n  <li>Glare reduction</li>\n  <li>Corrosiveness retardant</li>\n  <li>Embedded software</li>\n  <li>Pan/tilt degree of freedom</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto focus</li>\n  <li>Storage size internal</li>\n  <li>Storage size external</li>\n  <li>Ruggedization (IP rating)</li>\n  <li>RF shielding</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto Iris</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto recording</li>\n  <li>Sensor infrared capable</li>\n  <li>Data compression type</li>\n  <li>Sensor wide angle view</li>\n  <li>Power requirements</li>\n  <li>Mean time to failure</li>\n  <li>Mean time to repair</li>\n  <li>Low light capture</li>\n  <li>Operating temperature</li>\n  <li>Installation requirements</li>\n  <li>Firmware updates</li>\n  <li>Warranty length</li>\n  <li>Technical support</li>\n  <li>Scalability</li>\n  <li>Ease of operation</li>\n  <li>Maintenance/repair</li>\n  <li>Learning curve</li>\n  <li>Reliability</li>\n  <li>Redundancy</li>\n  <li>Rough % annual cost</li>\n  <li>Local/remote control</li>\n  <li>Sensor movement</li>\n  <li>Sensor storage</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto tracking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Please note</strong> that the Challenge is a tiered approach, so not all registered submitters will make it to the Competition stages. The Fleet VI CC encompasses six total stages. Stages #1 to #3 are for all registered submitters. Stages #4 to #6 are for the down-selected six or less but more than two submitters who will make it to the Competition. The six selected submitters will now be referred to as competitors. They will be notified on January 18, 2021.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage #4: Virtual Question &amp; Answer Session</strong></p>\n\n<p>The virtual question and answer (Q&amp;A) session is designed to provide information about the logistics of the presentation and demonstration phases of the Competition. The date of the Q&amp;A session will be tentative for <strong>JANUARY 27, 2021</strong>. An EC member will notify the competitors about the final date and time ONE WEEK prior to this tentative date. Although, the Q&amp;A session is outlined in the evaluation section, by no means will the Q&amp;A session be an evaluation stage. The competitors will not be evaluated during this stage, so no additional information is needed. The purpose of the Q&amp;A session is to provide any needed clarification for competitors about the logistics of the Competition stage. The EC will provide a meeting link, date, and time for the Q&amp;A session. The session meeting will be for two hours and will be conducted virtually on the Microsoft Teams platform. All competitors moving onto stages #5 and #6 will have one representative logged-in during this stage; however, competitors may have other representatives with them sharing the one login link. During this stage, the competitors will be congratulated. Covered topics will be the location, date, time, lodging, and arrival instructions. Competitors will have an opportunity to ask questions associated with the presentation and demonstration phases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stage #5: Competition</strong></p>\n\n<p>This stage will take place at Naval Base Point Loma at the NIWC Pacific Bayside location. The Competition days are currently scheduled for March 8th and 9th, 2021. EC members will send a data request to all competitors in January 2021 for base access. During this stage, the competitors will present and demonstrate their Hardware Solution. Competitor will be given specific arrival, base access, transition, presentation, demonstration, and departure times.</p>\n\n<p>Competitors will be grouped in a competition track. For example, Day one will be titled Track #1 and day two will be titled Track #2. During the first day of the Competition, EC members will be able to evaluate three competitors (competitors #1, #2, #3). On the second day EC will process the last three competitors (competitor #4, #5, #6). The image below represents a single day example of the throughput of the Competition. Please read each bolded section for details of each transitional phase. If for some reason any competitor fails to show within 30-minutes of their designated date and or time, that competitor will be disqualified from the Competition stage and the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competition Track</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/competition_track.jpg\" alt=\"Competition Track\" title=\"Competition Track\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Arrival/Base Access Phase</strong>\nFor both Track #1 (day one March 8, 2021) and Track #2 (day two March 9, 2021) there are only three arrival times (0730, 0930, 1130). Each competitor will be informed and reminded prior to the Competition start date of their arrival times. It is highly imperative that competitors arrive at their designated date and time. EC members will wait up to 30 minutes on the assigned date and time for a late competitor. The late time will be taken from the competitor’s presentation phase if the competitor is late. Competitors who fail to arrive within 30 minutes of their designated date and time will be disqualified from the Competition stage and the Challenge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>NIWC Pacific Bayside Pass Office</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/niwcpac_bayside_pass_office.jpg\" alt=\"NIWC Pacific Bayside Pass Office\" title=\"NIWC Pacific Bayside Pass Office\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Base Access Phase</strong></p>\n\n<p>The base access phase has a 30-minute window. The location of the Competition will be NIWC Pacific, Point Loma/Bayside. This location requires two forms of identification (Common Access Card and NIWC Pacific badge). Each competitor will receive a base access data request in January 2021. An EC member will submit temporary badge requests for each responding attendee. The SA will manage the base access for competitors. An EC member will meet each competitor at their designated arrival times by the front door of the NIWC Pacific Bayside Pass Office (Strothe Rd, San Diego CA 92106). This location is identified by the YELLOW star and Black rectangle in the image above. It is at that time and location where the competitor will receive their badges and will have access to drive onto to NIWC Pacific Bayside. An EC member will guide the competitor to their assigned parking location near the Competition area.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation Phase</strong></p>\n\n<p>The start of the presentation phase is marked at 30-minutes post arrival time for the competitors. This timed phase is limited to 2-hours. Competitors will be required to set up their two-Sensor Hardware Solution at the presentation site. This is for the ECE to get a close look at the equipment and ask appropriate questions. Competitors will have a designated EC member as support at the presentation phase location. The member will be responsible for equipment support and set up of PowerPoint presentation slides. In addition, the member will ensure that the competitor is ready to present at their designated time. The presentation phase is the competitor’s opportunity to provide a detailed description of how their Hardware Solution functions. There is no strict instruction on how competitors must present; however, competitors are encouraged to have a presentation plan (Sales Pitch). ECE are looking for technology descriptions (e.g. PPT slides, video, or handouts), hands-on evaluation of hardware, and how the system will address OPTASK VI challenges for the Navy. The list below are topics of interest. A minimum of 45-minutes must be designated for ECE to get their hands on the equipment and ask detailed question about the technology.</p>\n\n<p>During the presentation phase, responses from competitors will be graded by the ECE using scorecards. An EC member will input the data into the baseline performance metric matrix under the presentation evaluation. This will be part of the competitor’s overall performance grade. A designated support EC member will maintain time and advise the competitor when their time is up. When the presentation phase is completed competitors will start to disassemble their set-up equipment. The competitors will be directed to the next phase of the Competition.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Resolution</li>\n  <li>Frame stabilization</li>\n  <li>Glare reduction</li>\n  <li>Corrosiveness retardant</li>\n  <li>Embedded software</li>\n  <li>Pan/tilt degree of freedom</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto focus</li>\n  <li>Storage size internal</li>\n  <li>Storage size external</li>\n  <li>Ruggedization (IP rating)</li>\n  <li>RF shielding</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto Iris</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto recording</li>\n  <li>Sensor infrared capable</li>\n  <li>Data compression type</li>\n  <li>Sensor wide angle view</li>\n  <li>Power requirements</li>\n  <li>Mean time to failure</li>\n  <li>Mean time to repair</li>\n  <li>Low light capture</li>\n  <li>Operating temperature</li>\n  <li>Installation requirements</li>\n  <li>Firmware updates</li>\n  <li>Warranty length</li>\n  <li>Technical support</li>\n  <li>Scalability</li>\n  <li>Ease of operation</li>\n  <li>Maintenance/repair</li>\n  <li>Learning curve</li>\n  <li>Reliability</li>\n  <li>Redundancy</li>\n  <li>Rough % annual cost</li>\n  <li>Local/remote control</li>\n  <li>Sensor movement</li>\n  <li>Sensor storage</li>\n  <li>Sensor Auto tracking</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Equipment Storage Location:</strong> Highlighted in black and orange are designed to give the competitors a location to store any excess material that will not be used during the presentation and demonstration phase. These locations will be equipped with tables and chairs. The orange highlighted storage location will only be for competitors’ numbers one, three, four, and six. The black highlighted will only be for competitors’ numbers two and five. Both locations will be marked.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Seating Area:</strong> Highlighted in blue is the seating area that is designed to give EC members, evaluators, and onlookers a location to sit. These locations will be equipped with a canopy, tables, and chairs.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation Area:</strong> Highlighted in yellow is the presentation area and is designed to be the location that the competitors use to present their Hardware Solution. This area will be equipped with a canopy, tables, chairs, TV with stand, and 120V power strips (labeled G1 and G2), RJ45 CAT 6 cables, power cords, and a presentation remote. In addition, this area will have a competitor booth area with appropriate tables, chairs, and stands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Staging Area:</strong> Highlighted in purple is the staging area and is designed to be the location that competitors use to conduct their mock-up installation of their Hardware Solution. This area will be equipped with three tripod stands, TV with stand, Cat-6 Ethernet cables, power strips, power cord, and a Network-Attached Storage (NAS) device that will be designated to each competitor. A NAS will be used to store any feed from a competitors Hardware Solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Presentation Area Floor Plan</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/presentation_area_floor_plan.jpg\" alt=\"Presentation Area Floor Plan\" title=\"Presentation Area Floor Plan\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Transition Phase</strong>\nIn the transition phase competitors will be guided to the demonstration phase site location. All equipment needed to set up two-Sensor Hardware Solution system will need to be carried to the demonstration location. This transition phase is limited to 30-minutes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demonstration Phase</strong>\nThe demonstration phase is the competitor’s opportunity to showcase how their Hardware Solution functions. At the demonstration location, competitors will be asked to set up their Hardware Solution. There Hardware Solution must have a two-Sensors integrated system for the demonstration. A designated EC member will help with their setup. A networked attached storage device will be provided at the presentation phase and must be able to integrate as an external storage device to the competitors Hardware Solution to collect the demonstration data. The EC member will be responsible for clearly identifying the competitors dedicated NAS and ensuring the proper connection between the competitors Hardware Solution. The competitors will be asked to sign the NAS with a marker. The NAS device will be used later for scoring of the captured footage/photos.</p>\n\n<p>A floating platform will be located at the demonstration site. Here the competitor will install their two-Sensor Hardware Solution. On the floating platform there will be a center mark that indicates where the center of the Sensor lens must be placed. Once the Sensors are mounted, they must not be moved or touched. In addition, there will be a distinctive marker in front of the platform. This marker indicates a point-of-view reference and will be identified as “platform marker”. Competitors will need to maintain continuous recording regardless of what is required at each phase and all markers both on the vessel and on the platform need to be on all video clips and photos. The EC member will script all phases. They will direct the vessel when to depart and when the competitor will need to start recording. The vessel used in the Competition will be modified to have three distinctive markers. The markers will be used to grade the image clarity and stability at varying speeds, maneuvers, and distances.</p>\n\n<p>During setup it is encouraged that competitors engage with the evaluators. This gives the evaluators an installation perspective and an overall understanding of how the system works. The demonstration phase will be broken into three different routes that make up a triangular path and one post file recover phase.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #1 Crossing Bow VI Event:</strong> This phase will simulate a VI event where an adversary vessel will cross the bow of a U.S. vessel. Once the vessel departs, the marked vessel will travel from the floating marker to waypoint D1 at a steady speed. Once the vessel reaches the D1 waypoint, the EC member will inform the competitor to take a still image and a 60-second clip must be recorded. The video clip and photo must be saved and identified as WAYPOINT_D1_VIDEO and WAYPOINT_D1_PHOTO. The markers will be used to grade the image clarity and stability at a constant vessel speed at a 1000-yard distance. Again, all still images and video clips must contain the floating platform marker and the vessel markers. These are the two requirements in this phase. The continuous recording will also be reviewed during the judging phase and is always a requirement regardless of phase. If still images and 60-second clips are not possible while the competitors Hardware Solution is continuously recording; the competitors may quickly review their footage and create these files prior to the next phase. See image below for route.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #1 Ship Route</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/phase1_ship_route.png\" alt=\"Phase 1 Ship Route\" title=\"Phase 1 Ship Route\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #2 Erratic Behavior VI Event:</strong> This phase will simulate a VI event where an adversary vessel is acting erratically and making unsafe and unpredictable maneuvers. The marked vessel will now maneuver from waypoint D1 to D2 at an increased speed. This location will be approximately 850-yards from the platform marker in an orthogonal manner. Once the vessel reaches the D2 waypoint, the EC member will inform the competitor to take a still image and a 60-second clip must be recorded. The video clip and photo must be saved and identified as WAYPOINT_D2_VIDEO and WAYPOINT_D2_PHOTO. The marked vessel will now maneuver from waypoint D2 to D3 in a distinctive pattern and at various speeds. The EC member will inform the competitor to take a still image and a 60-second clip when the vessel reaches the D3 waypoint. The video clip and photo must be saved and identified as WAYPOINT_D3_VIDEO and WAYPOINT_D3_PHOTO. This location will be 2000-yards from the platform marker. Again, all still images and video clips must contain the floating platform marker and the vessel markers. The markers are needed to grade the image clarity at various distances, speeds, and maneuvers. There are the four requirements in this phase. The continuous recording will also be reviewed during the judging phase. If still images and 60-second clips are not possible while the competitors Hardware Solution is continuously recording; the competitors may quickly review their footage and create these files prior to the next phase. See image below for route.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #2 Ship Route</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/phase2_ship_route.jpg\" alt=\"Phase 2 Ship Route\" title=\"Phase 2 Ship Route\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #3 Aggressive Maneuver VI Event:</strong> This phase will simulate a VI event where an adversary vessel is conducting an aggressive maneuver. The marked vessel now maneuvers from waypoint D3 to D4 at an increased speed. The EC member will inform the competitor to take a still image and a 60-second clip when the vessel reaches the D4 waypoint. The video clip and photo must be saved and identified as WAYPOINT_D4_VIDEO and WAYPOINT_D4_PHOTO. This location will be 1000-yards from the platform marker. The marked vessel will now maneuver from waypoint D4 to D5 in a steady speed. The TC member will inform the competitor to take a still image and a 60-second clip when the vessel reaches the D5 waypoint. The video clip and photo must be saved and identified as WAYPOINT_D_VIDEO and WAYPOINT_D5_PHOTO.This location will be 500-yards from the platform marker. The markers are needed to grade the image clarity at various distances, speeds, and maneuvers. Again, all still images and video clips must contain the floating platform marker and the vessel markers. These are the four requirements in this phase. The continuous recording will also be reviewed during the judging phase. If still images and 60-second clips are not possible while the competitors Hardware Solution is continuously recording; the competitors may quickly review their footage and create these files prior to the next phase. See image below for route.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #3 Ship Route</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/phase3_ship_route.jpg\" alt=\"Phase 3 Ship Route\" title=\"Phase 3 Ship Route\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase #4 Post File Recovery and Showcase:</strong> \nPrior to the start of this phase all files must be transferred from the competitor’s internal storage device to the EC designated NAS. The competitors must transfer the files in the smallest file size possible. This will test the competitor’s systems ability to compress high resolution data files.</p>\n\n<p>This phase will test the reliability of the competitor’s solution. Once the competitors have transferred all files of the previous phases, power to their system will be completely removed and they will be forced to reboot the system. During the startup judges will see how the systems recovers and from there can ask appropriate function questions. During the recover the demonstration EC member will be monitoring the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>System reboot tests time for both sensors and video management</li>\n  <li>How long the system will take to recover from a sudden power loss</li>\n  <li>Recovery of stored video files</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once the system recovers the competitors will be required pan both their sensor all the way left and right. At each side, a still image needs to be captured and identified as PANLEFT_POTO and PANRIGHT_PHOTO. In addition, the competitors will be required tilt both their sensor all the way up and down. At each side, a still image needs to be captured and identified as UP_POTO and DOWN_PHOTO. These files must be transferred from the competitor’s internal storage device to the EC designated NAS.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demonstration Area Floor Plan</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/demonstration_area_floor_plan.png\" alt=\"Demonstration Area Floor Plan\" title=\"Demonstration Area Floor Plan\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Data Collection Point:</strong> Highlighted in orange is the data collection area. This area will be the dedicated location were all data is collected from the Sensors. This area will be fully equipped with tables, chairs, monitors, dedicated competitor NAS, RJ45 connectors with cables, power strips, power cords, and a laptop machine. The competitor will set their system up and allow for their system to accept an external storage NAS system provide by EC. In addition, this is the location where ECE will be monitoring the Sensors footage and asking various questions about the Hardware Solution. It will also be the central point where the EC member will manage the ship route script and advise the competitor when the demonstration is transitioning between phases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Demonstration Area:</strong> Highlighted in purple is the demonstration area. This area will be equipped with a multi-tripod set up that will allow competitors to install their Sensors. This mounting system will be mounted on a floating platform. This location is located approximately 350-feet from the presentation location. The purpose of mounting the competitor’s equipment on a floating platform is to mimic the motion of a ship. The floating platform will be equipped with POE category 6 cable, 120V power cord, 120V power strips, and tripods.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Base Departure Phase</strong>\nIn the departure phase competitors will be asked to leave the Competition site once they have completed their phases. If the competitors were given a visitor’s base access badge, they will surrender the badges to a designated SA. The SA will escort the competitors off the base. If some competitors were escorted onto the base with a RED BADGE, they will be escorted off the base by a SA member.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Submission Email:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>ammar.d.ameen@spawar.navy.mil</li>\n  <li>mark.a.thomsen@spawar.navy.mil</li>\n</ul>\n"

            "description": "<p>Each year the federal government spends more than $70 billion on extramural research projects undertaken by universities and companies across the nation that focus on a wide range of scientific and technology developments. This research often leads to the creation of numerous inventions that help drive innovation and significantly contribute to our country’s economic growth and prosperity.</p>\n\n<p>In 1980, Congress passed the Bayh-Dole Act which established the current rules governing the rights and responsibilities of extramural (external to the U.S. Government) recipients of Federal research and development (R&amp;D) funds. The law allows funding recipients to retain the intellectual property rights (IP) associated with the technologies they produce. Additionally, the law requires several compliance requirements that impact ownership rights, including timely reporting to the Federal funding agency of inventions disclosure, notice of title election to funded inventions, and filing of patent applications. The compliance elements are designed to protect the public’s investment by ensuring that the IP associated with resulting inventions are developed in a timely and correct manner.</p>\n\n<p>Both Federal funding agencies as well as recipients of federal funds benefit from compliance with the requirements of Bayh-Dole regulations. Noncompliance with Bayh-Dole regulations results in underreporting of IP that arises from R&amp;D activities funded by U.S. taxpayers. The incomplete reporting is concerning as it is not an accurate representation of the value derived for the Nation from Federal R&amp;D investments in industry and nonprofit organizations, including universities. Inventors at universities, small businesses, and other recipients of federal R&amp;D funding should report their inventive successes as a way to contribute to the data used by policy makers and stakeholders to assess the value, performance, and impact of extramural programs.</p>\n\n<p>Many large institutions have well-established technology transfer offices that routinely comply with Bayh-Dole regulations, but studies have shown that many recipients, especially small businesses and universities, have a comparatively poor compliance record. Though funding recipients may lose rights to Bayh-Dole subject invention patents, there may be many causes for underreporting and non-compliance with Bayh-Dole reporting requirements. Adding to the problem, many funding agencies routinely fail to adhere to compliance issues.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this Challenge is to inform the development and execution of program activities and communications designed to promote Bayh-Dole compliance. Successful submissions will propose mechanisms that motivate increased Bayh-Dole compliance reporting activities by recipients of Federal R&amp;D funding.</p>\n\n<p>Respondents to this Challenge are asked to submit creative ideas and solutions that will help organizations overcome barriers in Bayh-Dole compliance reporting.

            "description": "<p>The NIWC Atlantic Palmetto Tech Prize Challenge is seeking submissions for the following two topics. This prize challenge is under 10 USC § 2374a and is considered an independent effort.  However, the results of this prize challenge may result in an additional follow-on acquisition opportunity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic 1: Robotic Process Automation (RPA)</strong>\nCreating, managing, and sustaining our command’s data resources and repositories is a daily requirement for our business operation competencies (Finance, Contracts, HR, Supply Chain, etc).  Most of this work is extremely manual in nature with standard business practices and rules that Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions should be able to accommodate.  RPA will allow us to move our employees away from these manually intensive tasks to more high-value work.</p>\n\n<p>In Fiscal Year 2020 (FY20), NIWC Atlantic began developing attended bots for a few of our competencies as proof of concepts/pilots to show the value RPA can provide to our command.  NIWC Atlantic utilized the RPA Playbook developed by the Federal RPA community of practice to align with the desktop model approach.  While these attended bots have demonstrated the value automation can provide to the command, they are constrained to individual users and their computer assets being dedicated to execute.  NIWC Atlantic conducts most of our business operations through Department of Defense (DoD) approved networks and tools which require DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) credentials to access and operate.  Our attended bots require a user to initiate and leave their DoD Common Access Card (CAC) with PKI credentials inside their computer as the bots require those to operate within our network and tools.  While the bots are running, users are unable to utilize their computer or CAC for other work that needs to be executed.</p>\n\n<p>NIWC Atlantic is seeking RPA expertise to understand Enterprise RPA solutions that provide unattended bots that can be scheduled or triggered based on input received.  An unattended, Enterprise RPA solution will allow NIWC Atlantic to achieve the true value RPA provides, enabling us to focus our human capital towards more analytical, innovative, and meaningful work.  The unattended RPA solution would require DoD PKI credentials to operate within our environments and will need to be able to operate on the Navy Marine Corp Intranet (NMCI) network where all of our work is executed.  The NMCI network is a DoD approved network with stringent security requirements and software application approvals that will need to be factored into potential solutions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic 2: Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)</strong>\nThe Marine Corps seeks an alternative strategy to provide Position, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) inputs in environments where input may not be available or not as reliable from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) constellation. Any viable alternative must operate under conditions where radio frequency PNT signals are temporarily or permanently denied, degraded, or unreliable. Ability to overcome additional constraints of the operating environment (such as environments indoors, underground, or where radio frequency signals cannot be received) is also of value. Ideal solutions should be able to support diverse use cases in support of small, mobile systems, including dismounted Marines using an alternative PNT data input to locate and track oneself, and others (by feeding such input into a network). Use cases include individuals/units navigating within a building or across large geographic areas, and using alternative PNT data input to locate and track individuals, small unmanned surface, subsurface, or air vehicles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Challenge will go through a two-stage judging process.</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>Stage 1: Initial Submissions.</em></strong> Submissions will be judged by panel members with resident knowledge of the subject.  Judging panel members will evaluate each submission based on the criteria outlined in the judging criteria below.  Each topic will be evaluated separately and independently from one another.  The goal of Stage 1 for the evaluators is to select five (5) participants and one (1) alternate to present oral presentations at the CDCA Summit on March 3, 2021.  In the event that one of the first five (5) participants selected for oral presentations cannot attend the CDCA Summit, the alternate’s participant will be contacted for interest in presenting an oral presentation.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Stage 2: Oral Presentations at the CDCA Summit.</em></strong> The top five (5) participants for each technology category will be invited to present, at their own cost, the technology topic associated with their initial submission.   The oral presentation will be conducted with the Government evaluators and other government representatives interested in the exchange.  The audience could be made up of both CDCA Conference attendees and government representatives.  If the Presenter wishes to have only government representatives in attendance, the participant will need to notify the organizer of this prize challenge in advance of the presentation.  The oral presentation should be limited to a not to exceed 30 minute period followed by approximately 20 minutes of questions and answers. Only the government evaluators will ask questions. At the conclusion of all oral presentations, the Government judging panel team will privately discuss the oral presentations to determine the Prize Challenge winner and a runner up.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Prize Challenge Winner for each topic will be announced on the third day of the CDCA Summit, 5 March, 2021.  Each topic will present a Prize of $10,000 and also an Honorable Mention for the runner up.</p>\n\n<p>Prizes will be distributed to the eligible winners via electronic funds transfer (EFT), within 90 business days of the announcement of the winner(s).  NIWC Atlantic will distribute the funds evenly to all team members. Eligibility to receive an award is based upon the participant’s adherence to all rules for this Challenge. Funding for this Challenge will come from both overhead and direct funding.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>If the Prize Challenge winners have previously done business with the US Government and have a CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code.  The winner will be able to provide that information to the contest organizers.  The contest organizers will use it to complete the SF 1034, public voucher other than personnel.   The winner will then submit the completed voucher to vendor pay.  Vendor pay would then certify the payment.</li>\n  <li>If the winners do not already have a CAGE code, they need go to the System for Award Management (SAM) URL <a href=\"https://www.sam.gov/SAM/\">https://www.sam.gov/SAM/</a>.   The winner will then create an account and register their business.  Once they do that they will be assigned a CAGE code.  Once they have the CAGE code, they would give the CAGE code to the contest organizers, who would use it to complete the SF 1034.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Schedule:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>Stage 1</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Submissions 06 November – 20 December 2020</li>\n      <li>Judging: 21 December 2020 – 18 January 2021</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Stage 2</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>Invitation to Participants for Oral Presentations by 29 January 2021</li>\n      <li>RSVP by 05 February 2021</li>\n      <li>Oral Submissions electronic briefing material provided by 23 February 2021</li>\n      <li>Oral Presentations on 3 March 2021</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Winners Announced 5 March 2021</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n",

All of these interventions are aimed at improving outcomes for our Veterans.</p>\n\n<p>We invite interested solvers to participate in a three-month AI Tech Sprint. The sprint is an iterative prototyping process where outside teams will receive novel synthetic data and connect with health care providers, experts, and stakeholders from the Department of Veterans Affairs. We will work with each team to craft a suitable project that fits the team’s abilities and improves VA care. Teams will participate in weekly meetings with government experts and researchers, and monthly opportunities to demonstrate a prototype. The tech sprint culminates in a demo day, where participants receive recognition from the VA as well as $100,000 in total awards.</p>\n\n<p>Select projects may also receive offers to pilot their product with VA hospitals, the largest health care system in the United States.

The Navy’s Information Assurance and Cybersecurity Program Office (PMW 130) seeks to enhance the Security Operations Center (SOC) using automated artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools to automate the detection and prevention of advanced persistent threat (APT) and other cybersecurity campaign activity. Current SOC operations require a tremendous amount of time and effort to triage alerts, link related logs, perform incident response, and document investigations. Through this AI ATAC Prize Challenge, PMW 130 is soliciting Security Orchestration &amp; Automated Response (SOAR) tools that use AI/ML to enhance their effectiveness for competitive evaluation. Submissions must be accompanied by a submission description white-paper plus an overview video and a demonstration video describing the SOAR tool and associated technologies.</p>\n\n<p>This Challenge seeks to evaluate the utility of SOAR tools for NAVWAR security operation center (SOC) teams. SOAR tools as used in this challenge are technologies to coordinate, manage, and automate an organization’s SOC and federate an organization’s security processes, workflows, and procedures to provide a centralized, coordinated security posture for that organization. SOAR tools should significantly enhance the ability of security operators and analysts to perform their tasks (e.g., alert handling, ticket processing, threat detection, incident response, and post-compromise forensics) by providing machine-powered assistance to human analysts to improve the efficiency and consistency of people and processes. For instance, workflows or playbooks define the set of steps to address a potential threat, and SOAR tools may execute these steps automatically or guide a human analyst through them. SOAR tools using AI/ML should greatly enhance these benefits.</p>\n\n<p>For the purposes of this competition, SOAR tools are defined as tools that perform, coordinate, and automate the following actions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Ingest logs and alerts from a wide variety of security tools in a SOC;</li>\n  <li>Ingest or provide threat intelligence information from both internal and external sources;</li>\n  <li>Combine, coordinate, and enrich logging, alert, and threat data in the tool’s User Interface (UI);</li>\n  <li>Identify common attack patterns and highlight them in the tool’s UI;</li>\n  <li>Automate and ultimately simplify the alert triage and incident response processes via preset and configurable workflows or playbooks;</li>\n  <li>Facilitate simultaneous or asynchronous (e.g., via sharing or handing off) investigations by different, potentially geographically disparate operators, with access to potentially different types of information; and</li>\n  <li>Automate and expedite documentation of triage, incident response, and forensics (e.g., via ticketing).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This Challenge will measure the performance of these tools to determine how well they would provide improvements to U.S. Navy SOCs across the world.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>10 December 2020: Kick-off of AI ATAC 3 on Challenge.gov</li>\n  <li>22 January 2021: Deadline for potential Participants to send an email to indicate intent to participate (details below)</li>\n  <li>12 February 2021: All submissions due</li>\n  <li>TBD: Candidates selected for Phase 2 will be notified by email</li>\n</ul>\n",

In the case of a single winner, the entire cash prize will be awarded to the winning entry. In the unlikely event of a tie, NAVWARSYSCOM will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes. If a prize goes to a team of Participants, NAVWARSYSCOM will award the cash prize to the individual/team’s point of contact registered on the Challenge.gov website.</p>\n\n<p>Tax treatment of prizes will be handled in accordance with U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The winner must provide a U.S. Taxpayer Identification Number (e.g., a SSN, TIN, EIN) to receive the cash prize.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"non-monetary-prizes\">Non-monetary Prizes</h4>\n\n<p>NAWARSYSCOM may award, pursuant to Title 10 U.S.C. § 2371b, a follow-on production contract or transaction to one or more Participants who successfully demonstrated an effective AI/ML SOAR capability under the Challenge. The Challenge, however, does not in any way obligate NAVWARSYSCOM to procure any of the items within the terms or bounds of this Challenge from any Participant, including from the Challenge winner(s).</p>\n",
            "rules": "<p>Each Participant (individual Participant, team of Participants, or commercial entity) shall submit one entry in response to this Challenge. Team or commercial entity entries must identify one individual as a primary point of contact (POC) and prize recipient. By submitting an entry, a Participant authorizes his or her name to be released to the media if the Participant wins the prize.</p>\n\n<p>While reading this section, it may be helpful to refer to the “How to Enter” section, which itemizes the detailed requirements of a submission package. The “How to Enter” section provides instructions for submitting the package.</p>\n\n<p>This Challenge will be conducted in two successive phases.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1</strong> \nThe Phase 1 submission package will provide the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Submission description White-paper (document);</li>\n  <li>Overview and Demonstration videos (each less than 10 minutes long);</li>\n  <li>The SOAR technology itself (via VM, hardware, and/or any included and necessary software); and,</li>\n  <li>A setup guide (document). See Submission Requirements below for the specifics of each submission component.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Phase 1 will be used to identify the most promising candidate technologies that will be selected for and advanced to Phase 2 evaluation. These selections will be based on the technology’s Whitepaper document plus the Overview and Demonstration videos. SOAR tool submitters must be available during Phase 1 for any questions by the U.S. Navy and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) teams.</p>\n\n<p>PMW 130 will notify all Contestants that advance to Phase 2 using the contact information provided in the submission. The Government, may, but is not necessarily required to, notify Contestants that do not advance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2</strong>\nPhase 2 will involve more in-depth evaluation of candidate technologies by subject matter experts at ORNL and actual SOC operators from both ORNL and the U.S. Navy. It will require a fifth and final submission component, namely (5) a User Tutorial video. Upon notification of selection for Phase 2, further instructions and a deadline will be provided to only the selected technologies for the (5) User Tutorial video.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, technical assistance to ORNL’s team is expected for ensuring expedient and proper set-up of the submitted SOAR tool into ORNL’s environment during Phase 2. Remote support (video- or tele-conferences) will be scheduled with the submission team’s technical point of contact (POC) specified in the Phase 1 submission package.</p>\n\n<p>Once technologies are appropriately configured, Phase 2 evaluation will commence. Phase 2 will include a hands-on test of the SOAR tool, conducted by multiple SOC operators, while red-team attack campaigns are administered. The environment will include relevant background traffic and real users populating the test network. Tests involving collaboration of multiple operators using the SOAR tool may be conducted, both for operators working in the same network SOC and when handing off investigations to operators in a different network’s SOC.</p>\n\n<p>Expertise of SOC analysts is particularly important and relevant to Phase 2, and access to SOC expertise is limited; consequently, Phase 2 will be evaluated on a smaller subset of Phase 1 Participants. Additional tests of each SOAR tool, to measure further quantitative and qualitative metrics, will be performed by ORNL research staff.</p>\n\n<p>All questions regarding the Challenge should be sent via email to <a href=\"mailto:AIATAC.PRIZE.CHALLENGE@NAVY.MIL\">AIATAC.PRIZE.CHALLENGE@NAVY.MIL</a> no later than 22 January 2021, 1700 EST.

The Participant may choose any aspects of their tool to showcase, but areas of interest to the U.S. Navy include:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>The Threat Intelligence Platform – how the tool knows of likely threat locations and types; who provides the threat data and how;</li>\n      <li>Worthwhile Automated - automatic identification and resolution of simple but voluminous alerts and warnings (accurate methods to reduce repetitive actions by an analyst);</li>\n      <li>Incorporated AI/ML - AI/ML tools, components, or processes that can identify unusual threats or conditions, and alert the operators accordingly;</li>\n      <li>Flexible Integrations - Interoperability or extensibility with other tools or platforms and/or APIs used;</li>\n      <li>Metrics - Examples of metrics generated, especially those that show time saved, value gained, number of incidents handled, et cetera, and</li>\n      <li>Offline/Online – How well the tool works offline (i.e. not in the cloud or only on a network without cloud connectivity).</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>The videos should demonstrate the SOAR tool’s capability and highlight the value and ease-of-use of the SOAR tool. Any other desired functionality is welcome within the at-most-10-minute videos. Extra videos or any content after 10 minutes in a video will not be reviewed.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Video format</strong>: Videos must be provided in MP4 file format or provided via a link to be viewed online. If the videos are encrypted or protected, please provide a password.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Technology Software and/or VM Submission Requirements</strong></p>\n\n    <p>The software components for SOAR technology must meet the following criteria:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p><strong>Software Format</strong>: It can be in one of the following formats:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Software that can be run on modern Windows or Linux OSes (e.g., the U.S. Navy is moving towards all Windows 10 and uses Red Hat Enterprise 7.x in some environments)</li>\n          <li>Exported virtual machine (VM) images in .ovf or .ova format that are compatible with VMWare ESXi 6.7 (i.e., they MUST readily import into VMWare, no conversion should be done)</li>\n          <li>Docker container packages (i.e., using the Docker tar command)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p><strong>Hardware Format:</strong></p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Technologies selected for Phase 2 can provide their technologies pre-installed on hardware server systems or provide co-processing systems for their technology.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p><strong>Cloud and On-Premises (On-prem) Requirements</strong>:  For testing, submitted technologies will be installed on the Cybersecurity Operations Research Range (CORR) evaluation environment at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Due to the potential variety of solution types, the Challenge will accept solutions that require access to external resources as well as solutions that are hosted on-prem. Submitted technologies will be allowed to use the Cloud, via the Internet, to run their software during this challenge.  We expect this to facilitate checking of license keys, checking threat databases, running portions of the code remotely on vendor systems, and so on.  However, NAVWAR and ORNL may be running portions of the challenge in a D-DIL (denied, degraded, intermittent, or limited) environment, to determine the impact of D-DIL on the effectiveness of the tool and the operators running it.</p>\n\n        <p>As such, during a portion of the testing, no connection to the Internet or an external Cloud should be expected, and all technologies and licenses will be evaluated as to their ability to function without connectivity to a Cloud environment or the Internet.</p>\n\n        <p>During a portion of testing, ORNL will test the ability of the submitted technology to facilitate  collaboration of SOCs on different networks using their own instances of the SOAR tool. All networks will be inside CORR (ORNL’s testbed). To test interaction of the SOCs/SOAR tools across networks, there are two options, as follows:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Internet connections will be provided to enable connections to the Cloud. Cloud provision and configuration must be provided by the submitting team if this option is used. (SOC-A talks to SOC-B via an external connection.)</li>\n          <li>Solutions that do not require external Cloud access, but do allow coordinating across connected networks within ORNL’s testbed are permitted, in lieu of Cloud connections. This simulates connecting multiple SOCs all on a separate enclave, e.g., SIPRnet. (SOC-A talks to SOC-B directly on an internal network.)</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <p>The submitter should select the tools and configuration that they believe will best meet the Navy’s need, whether that solution uses a private Cloud, virtual Cloud, an on-prem solution, or some combination of them. The important necessity is that multiple networks with different instances of this SOAR tool must be able to collaborate either using a remote capability (Cloud or external Internet) or via an ORNL-on-prem capability (internal, private networks).</p>\n\n        <p>Regardless of the proposed solution type, all necessary components (software, licenses, configuration / setup instructions, and potentially hardware) must be provided by the submitter.  ORNL will allow external access to resources such as the Cloud, however, it will not provide external Cloud resources, either commercial or Government.</p>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>Instances required</strong>: Submissions must provide SOAR software for multiple instances to be configured on CORR, specifically, allowing up to 7 SOC operators per network on up to 3 small networks (each network can be assumed to include fewer than 5,000 IPs, with total bandwidth under 10Gb/s). These instances of the submitted SOAR technology must be able to integrate with each other both within and across networks (e.g., leveraging a virtual cloud or dedicated cross-network connection) to facilitate collaboration of SOC operators within and across networks using this SOAR tool. Any needed corresponding tools (e.g., SIEM of Zeek) must be included in the software / VM / hardware submission package and be as configured as possible. Any remaining configuration needed that may be specific to the test network MUST be provided along with the User Tutorial document if the SOAR tool is advanced to Phase 2.</li>\n      <li><strong>Licenses required</strong>: Software licenses for these instances must be valid through December 31, 2021 and must function properly without connectivity to the internet.</li>\n      <li>\n        <p><strong>Integration Requirements:</strong> Submission must ingest a wide variety of alerts and logs, including but not limited to:</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Host logs including Windows System Logs, Linux syslogs</li>\n          <li>Host-based defensive software logs including</li>\n          <li>Host firewall logs</li>\n          <li>Anti-virus, malware detection, and/or memory access/scripting violation logs</li>\n          <li>Endpoint detection and response logs</li>\n          <li>Endpoint policy compliance software logs</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Network-level defensive software logs including</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Network-level firewall logs</li>\n          <li>Intrusion detection and prevention system output</li>\n          <li>Network-level malware detector alerts</li>\n          <li>Network flow sensors</li>\n          <li>PCAP (packet capture)</li>\n          <li>Zeek logs</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>Vulnerability scanning tool outputs</li>\n      <li>\n        <p>Logs produced by network services, including</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>Active Directory</li>\n          <li>LDAP</li>\n          <li>Kerberos</li>\n          <li>DNS</li>\n          <li>Mail Client</li>\n          <li>DHCP</li>\n          <li>Threat intelligence platform information, both internally and externally</li>\n          <li>Ticketing or other documentation system(s)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Setup Guide Document Requirements</strong></p>\n\n    <p>The setup guide should be a concise, easy-to-follow set of instructions for installing the submission’s VM/Software/Hardware, configuring integrations with subsidiary SOC tools, and integrating multiple instances of this SOAR tool. A technical Point of Contact (POC) for assisting with proper setup and configuration should be included in the white-paper, along with the POC’s phone number and email.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Setup time requirements</strong>: All required components should be submitted as configured and integrated as much as possible. Submissions must provide sufficiently mature software, documentation (setup guide), and support to the ORNL test team to ensure that the submitted SOAR instances <strong>can be configured for use on the up-to-three small networks with at most 16 labor hours of support.</strong> Submissions requiring more than 16 labor hours for setup and configuration are subject to disqualification. It is critical that the technical POC be available during business hours during the challenge to avoid disqualification.</li>\n      <li><strong>Setup Support:</strong> The Submission team should be prepared to provide configuration support to the ORNL test team remotely (e.g. via phone or video conference) to facilitate proper setup and configuration. Setup configuration and support (virtual) meetings will be scheduled in advance of a needed meeting to accommodate the Challenge schedule.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>User Tutorial Video</strong></p>\n\n    <p>The User Tutorial Video is <strong>not</strong> required with Phase 1 submission. This will only be required of those Participant technologies selected for Phase 2. Further instructions and deadlines will be communicated to these Participants.</p>\n\n    <p>Submissions selected for Phase 2 testing must provide a training or tutorial video that teaches a new user (SOC operator) how to use the (already set up and configured) SOAR tool. The tutorial should take the user <strong>under 2 hours</strong> to complete and should assume that the tutorial user has a bachelor degree education level and 0-5 years of experience in cybersecurity or related field, and no experience in the specific SOAR tool. The tutorial video may further assume the user is using an instance of the submitted SOAR tool. The User Tutorial will be provided directly to both ORNL and U.S. Navy operators.

However, these non-state actors mostly operated in a two-dimensional battlespace that was mainly rural and urban sprawl, with little to no access to Electronic Warfare (EW) tools.</p>\n\n<p>Though the Special Operations community have become masters of the 2-dimensional threat environment over the past two decades, with today’s emerging threat environments, adversaries attempt to contest all domains with advanced technologies and take advantage of the complex and congested 3-dimensional battlespace. This reduces the effectiveness of SOF tactical maneuver elements, ISR and precision fires, creating the inability to maintain continuous airborne ISR feeds and key communications and navigation bands in the electromagnetic spectrum in these dense urban clutter environments, leaving our tactical maneuver elements challenged.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in a mission to infiltrate and obtain information or an asset from a sub terrain tunnel system in a contested and congested threat environment, AISUM could be used to gain intelligence and minimize human risk.  Conceptually, satellite imagery would provide the initial data used to generate a 3-dimensional terrain map of an area of operations, allowing mission planners, operators and drones to plan, train and rehearse within the simulated environment. These activities allow the team to develop and optimize specific tactics, techniques and procedures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>General Overview</strong></p>\n\n<p>This Prize Challenge reaches out to the defense, academic and industrial community to enhance research and development in the field of artificial intelligence for small unit maneuver. The objective of the Prize Challenge is for the development of an algorithm to enhance the maneuver and reconnaissance capabilities of autonomous drones within defined scenarios. The objective includes the utilization of the Government Furnished Property (GFP) drones, sensors, and onboard processing.</p>\n\n<p>Example Scenario 1:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Maneuver: Begin mission at entrance to building. Navigate through the building using open passages and any route to exit through open rear door.</li>\n  <li>Recon: Identify and count the number of key predefined objects, and simple properties (i.e. color) within the internal space (TBD: humans, object of interest)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Example Scenario 2:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Maneuver: Begin mission at entrance to building. Navigate through the building, around limited obstacles in order to maximize coverage, and then exit through open rear door.</li>\n  <li>Mapping: Collect data of internal space to produce, post-hoc, a 3D model of the internal environment.</li>\n  <li>Recon: Identify the number and location of key predefined objects within the internal space (TBD: humans, object of interest).</li>\n  <li>Recon: Identify numbers of civilians vs combatants (threat / no-threat) within internal space. (TBD: identifying characteristics)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The AISUM Prize Challenge is broken into three phases; technical white paper submission, virtual simulation environment, and live scenario at a military training site.</p>\n\n<p>Phase I will be conducted in two phases: Initial submission of White Paper Concept followed by an invitation to provide Virtual Presentation of the White Paper Concept. The White Paper Concept shall describe the details of the technical approach in response to the problem statement.</p>\n\n<p>White Paper Concept should be developed around the following conditions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>GFP will consist of stretch X drone, onboard processing, frontal camera, and optical avoidance sensors</li>\n  <li>Operation in a Non-GPS environment and an autonomous flight mode</li>\n  <li>Additional hardware payload proposals may be considered</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Government will select up to 25 White Papers Concept(s) for invitation for a Virtual Presentation of their proposed concept to a panel of judges.  The Virtual Presentation shall provide a summary of the White Paper Concept and include detail on how participants intend to accomplish the Prize Challenge objective. Up to 10 winners will be selected to participate in Phase II.</p>\n\n<p>Phase II participants shall develop specific algorithms that will be used to compete in virtual scenarios. The participants will be evaluated for their algorithms to be used within a Government provided virtual map. Participants shall provide the following items to the Government:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Unreal level log file (Log file shall provide drone positions during the maneuver and identify drone objects detected.).

For example, the text may include “printing drone position of x to log file” or “detected chair at x time”. Also, a .txt file containing the total number of uniquely identified objects of interest (e.g. “we identified 16 unique chairs”) must be provided when participant log files are sent to the Government.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Participants shall provide a Phase II White Paper response to the following questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Summary of the participant’s technical approach to include a description of the methods used, algorithms, novelty aspects, etc.</li>\n  <li>Description of the aspects of the participant’s solution that went as expected and what performed well during the participant’s recorded run.</li>\n  <li>Description of the aspects of the participant’s solution that went worse than expected or did not perform as well.</li>\n  <li>Provide rationale for any inconsistency between the provided unreal level log file and participant developed log file.</li>\n  <li>If selected for Phase III, how do you expect performance issues in Phase II will affect performance in the Phase III, real life scenario? Specifically, what are your plans to address and overcome these challenges?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The purpose of the Phase II White Paper response is to provide narrative to support participants’ solutions and delivered log files of the Virtual Presentation.

            "description": "<p>TSA is calling on innovators and citizen inventors to leverage innovative approaches and other innovations that would increase TSA’s security effectiveness and efficiency efforts and improve passenger experience. \nTo accomplish this mission, TSA is looking for the best possible solutions from you – the crowd – to help with <strong><em>The Power of Passengers Challenge</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>On any given day, TSA screens nearly nine million passengers and bags in the United States of America at more than 400 federalized airports. In order to accomplish this task, TSA employs a diverse mixture of security measures, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Approximately 50,000 transportation security officers</li>\n  <li>Nearly 950 imaging technology machines</li>\n  <li>More than 350 explosives specialists</li>\n  <li>More than 1,000 canine teams</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Beyond its well-known responsibility for securing airport locations in the United States, TSA also is responsible for inspecting foreign airports with flights departing to the United States, inspecting billions of tons of cargo annually, and securing more than 4,000 maritime ports and terminals and more than 600,000 bridges.</p>\n\n<p>The combined domestic and international efforts of the TSA use and generate large amounts of logistical, operational, and security data.</p>\n\n<p>TSA is looking harness new approaches and innovations, from other industries to improve overall security effectiveness, operational efficiency, and passenger experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Focus Areas</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will focus on:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>SITUATIONAL AND/OR OPERATIONAL AWARENESS:</strong> How can the TSA maintain situational and/or operational awareness in a variety of environments (e.g., airports, cargo, bridges, and maritime), with or without on-site personnel?</li>\n  <li><strong>SECURITY SCREENINGS:</strong> How can the TSA leverage the power of passengers before, during, and after security screenings without sacrificing effectiveness?</li>\n  <li><strong>PASSENGER ARRIVALS:</strong> How can passengers provide and share information about their impending airport arrival to facilitate more efficient screening processes?</li>\n  <li><strong>INTERNATIONAL ARRIVAL TRANSFERS:</strong> How can passengers arriving at a U.S. airport on an international flight more efficiently transfer to domestic flights without diminishing security?</li>\n  <li><strong>COVID-19 RECOVERY:</strong> How can the TSA enhance or alter current operations, procedures, or policies to contend with the changing dynamics in a post-COVID-19 transportation environment?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Challenge invites innovators and citizen investors to submit responses with approaches or innovations that can re-envision how the TSA generates, interprets and uses data to improve security, efficiency, and passenger experience.</p>\n\n<p>The TSA seeks responses that address one or more of the following areas of interest:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Area of Interest 1: Security Effectiveness</strong> – Improved security outcomes, improved false alarm rate, increased detection of prohibited items, improved identification of mal-actors, better situational awareness of security performance and effectiveness, etc.</li>\n  <li><strong>Area of Interest 2: More Efficient Options for Screening Passengers</strong> – More efficient use of screening personnel, decreased number of procedural steps, decreased cost per passenger screened, increased passenger screening speed, increased number of passengers screened, improved use of airport infrastructure (physical constraints), etc.</li>\n  <li><strong>Area of Interest 3: Improved Passenger Experience</strong> – Decreased passenger queue wait times, improved passenger divestiture of items, increased predictability of experience, improved ease of experience, greater levels and options for autonomy and self-service, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Whenever possible, proposed approaches should be largely invisible or unobtrusive to passengers.</p>\n\n<p>Proposed approaches may not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Add significant actions by the passenger unless for the benefit of or under the discretion of the passenger</li>\n  <li>Add significant wait times for the passenger unless for the benefit of or under the discretion of the passenger</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, proposed approaches may not result in increased costs for security or operational programs. Ideally, net costs to the TSA should be minimal, if any.</p>\n",

Projects funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund, administered by the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), support the development of data capacity and infrastructure that can engage patients in health care decision-making and incorporate their responses into research. The Synthetic Health Data Challenge (Challenge) is an important component of the <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/topic/research-evaluation/synthetic-health-data-generation-accelerate-patient-centered-outcomes\">Synthetic Health Data Generation to Accelerate PCOR Project</a>, through which ONC seeks to accelerate PCOR by furthering the development of Synthea™, a synthetic health data engine. The Challenge invites providers, researchers, and technology developers to develop innovative tools and resources that support validation and novel uses of synthetic data for PCOR researchers and/or health IT developers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong></p>\n\n<p>Clinical data are critical for patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR), which focuses on the effectiveness of prevention and treatment options. However, high-quality health care data are often difficult to access due to cost, patient consent, privacy concerns, or other legal or institutional review board (IRB) restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>Synthetic health data can augment the PCOR infrastructure by providing researchers with a low risk, readily available, synthetic data source to complement their use of real clinical data. Early access to synthetic data while researchers await access to real clinical data may enhance their ability to test rigorous analyses and/or software systems that may generate relevant findings to inform health and treatment decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Synthea is an open-source synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. The resulting data are free from cost and privacy- and security restrictions and have the potential to support a variety of academia, research, industry, and government initiatives. Synthea can use publicly available health statistics and other research sources. Because the software uses publicly available statistical data to generate synthetic data sets, the barriers to resource availability and privacy concerns are lower than for other synthetic data generation technologies that rely on manipulating actual patient data. The software includes a temporal model that covers a patient’s entire lifetime instead of focusing on one health problem or disease recorded at any singular point in time. Similar to other synthetic data sets, the synthetic data generated by Synthea must be validated to ensure they are clinically relevant and realistic.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge seeks a wide array of innovators, researchers, and technology developers to create and test innovative and novel solutions that will further cultivate the capabilities of Synthea and the synthetic data it generates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Structure</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will be conducted in two (2) phases:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Phase I – Proposal for Innovative Models:</strong> Participants will submit a written proposal describing their proposed solution, including methodology and intended outcomes. Selected Phase I proposals will proceed to Phase II. There is no limit to the number of qualified proposals that may be selected to move to Phase II; however, a minimum of four (4) qualified proposals are required for the Challenge to proceed to Phase II.</li>\n  <li><strong>Phase II – Prototype/Solution Development:</strong> Phase I proposals that are selected to proceed to Phase II will develop their prototype/solution at this stage.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Entry Categories</strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants will propose a solution in one of two (2) Challenge categories.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Category I – Enhancements to Synthea:</strong> Solutions in this category include, but are not limited to, development and/or enhancement of Synthea modules and development of solutions that enhance or address limitations of Synthea.</li>\n  <li><strong>Category II – Novel Uses of Synthea Generated Synthetic Data:</strong> Solutions in this category include, but are not limited to, novel uses of Synthea generated data for research and technology development.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/synthetic-health-data-challenge-faqs.pdf\">Frequently Asked Questions Document</a> (updated 04/20/2021)</li>\n  <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/synthetic-health-data-challenge_technical-guidance-and-tips.pdf\">Technical Guidance and Tips</a></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Example Modules, Module Companion Guides</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#cerebral_palsy\">Cerebral Palsy Module</a> and <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/module_companion_guide_cerebral_palsy_508.pdf\">Companion Guide</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#prescribing_opioids_for_chronic_pain_and_treatment_of_oud\">Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain and Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder Module</a> and <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/module_companion_guide_opioids_508.pdf\">Companion Guide</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#sepsis\">Sepsis Module</a> and <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/module_companion_guide_sepsis_508.pdf\">Companion Guide</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/#spina_bifida\">Spina Bifida</a> Module and <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/module_companion_guide_spina_bifida_508.pdf\">Companion Guide</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/synthetic-health-data-challenge-registration-form-1-.pdf\">Synthetic Health Data Challenge Registration Form</a></li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Phase I Informational Webinar (Feb 2, 2021 12:00 PM ET)</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/20210202_challenge-phase-i-informational-webinar-materials.pdf\">Webinar Materials</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Phase I Submission Period Opens: 01/19/2021 09:00 AM ET</li>\n  <li>Phase I Informational Webinar: 02/02/2021 12:00 PM ET</li>\n  <li>Phase I Submission Period Closes: 03/02/2021 05:00 PM ET</li>\n  <li>Phase I Finalists Announced: 03/23/2021 09:00 AM ET</li>\n  <li>Phase II Submission Period Opens: 03/23/2021 09:00 AM ET</li>\n  <li>Phase II Informational Webinar: 04/06/2021 12:00 PM ET</li>\n  <li>Phase II Submission Period Closes: 07/13/2021 05:00 PM ET</li>\n  <li>Award Announcement: 09/21/2021 09:00 AM ET</li>\n  <li>Winning Solutions Webinar: 10/19/2021 12:00 PM ET</li>\n</ul>\n",

For this challenge, PRO data are defined as “any report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient, without interpretation of the patient’s response by a clinician or other medical expert.” In other words, PRO data come from patient self-assessments and look beyond the clinical data to assess how a patient feels about his or her health.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-problem\"><strong>The Problem</strong></h4>\n\n<p>While PRO data have proven useful to healthcare providers, they are not widely used in clinical settings. Recently, some digital tools have been developed to streamline the collection of PRO data. However, those digital tools are not widely adopted due to challenges related to clinician workflow and patient ease with the tools. Also, researchers who want to analyze PRO data across different practices or health systems often encounter the issue that data are not collected in a standardized manner. Creating a digital tool to efficiently collect, aggregate, and share PRO data is critical to advancing the quality of care.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"phase-1-winners\"><strong>Phase 1 Winners</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Step Up App Challenge is seeking innovative technologists to develop user-friendly apps that collect standardized PRO data for clinical and research purposes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1 winners announced:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>AgilisIT:</strong> AgilisITTM’s solution focuses on patient engagement, ease of use for physicians, and EHR integration in order to encourage the digital collection of PRO data. The patient centered app offers both mobile and web applications, enabling patients to receive reminders and track their own progress while providers can receive patient health notifications and easily review data to prepare treatment plans based on patient priorities.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asymmetrik:</strong> Asymmetrik’s Phoenix Integration PlatformTMallows healthcare providers to use FHIR®to leverage existing investments in data infrastructure, simplify data analytics to make informed decisions across health systems, and deploy secure, data-driven applications for researchers, doctors, and patients. Built on the award-winning Phoenix ServerTM, Asymmetrik’s patient engagement solution can help healthcare providers improve patient engagement and care coordination by exchanging PRO data with patients, targeting patients with low response rates or certain medical conditions, and analyzing responses in real time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Booz Allen Hamilton:</strong> DEXi Care MapTMis an application designed to allow patients to interact directly with their providers including inputs from wearables, and has an easy-to-understand interface viewable to both the patient and provider that tracks progress. Using a combination of artificial intelligence (AI), machine intelligence (MI), and natural language processing (NLP), DEXi Care Map can provide tailored information to patients and providers and is able to parse user input and feedback into structured data.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Health Wizz:</strong> The Health WizzTMsolution incentivizes patients to provide sought after data through “Campaigns” (e.g., Chronic Disease Management Campaign, Patient Reported Outcome Campaign, etc.). Participants can choose to accept Campaign invitations and can receive rewards for participation. The data can be entered and tracked on the patient’s mobile device or wearable and can be transferred into an EHR system accessible to clinicians.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1upHealth:</strong> ProUpTMis a secure, patient facing application developed by 1upHealth that facilitates seamless integration between EHR systems and PRO data collected via easy to complete PRO questionnaires.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Qidza Inc:</strong> Qidza’s ProNogginTMmobile app is designed to improve the collection of PRO data by addressing health literacy gaps via simple designs, increasing patient engagement via personalization, and improving data aggregation and sharing via FHIR integration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>cliexa:</strong> Tailored for tracking chronic disease activity, cliexa®’s Platform for Chronic Care Management enables clinicians to fully leverage patient-reported data through allowing assessment customization, EMR integration, facial and voice recognition using AI, FDA linked databases for medication tracking functions, body maps and pain diagrams, and a reimbursement framework.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PEER Technologies, PLLC:</strong> PEER Technologies utilizes the Shared Decision Making (SDM) process between patients and providers in a user-friendly application that strives to improve patient knowledge and satisfaction through producing benchmarked PRO scores for patients and risk/benefit evaluation when discussing surgery. Patients easily enter PRO data regarding non-specific low back pain and are presented with comprehendible recommendations including personalized estimates of normative outcomes based on patients’ age, sex and other features.</p>\n\n<p><strong>PRISM:</strong> PRISMTMis an application developed by a multi-disciplinary team that enhances the quality of clinical discussion between healthcare providers and patients by providing the option for patients to fill out PRO questions before or during office visits via a mobile application or web site. Patients can compare their health trends to the overall population while providers and healthcare organizations have access to the PRO data from within the EHR. Providers have the ability to send individual reminders to patients and they can use dashboards to track population trends and patient response rates.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Social &amp; Scientific Systems PatientPort:</strong> PatientPortTMis a secure, patient-centric application leveraging a user-friendly interface to maximize engagement. The application is built to provide interoperability with user devices, regardless of operating system and can be integrated with commercially available EHR products to promote adoption by both health systems and patients.</p>\n\n<p>The ten Phase 1 winners will now move to Phase 2 Development.

            "description": "<p>Masks (also referred to as “barrier face coverings”) are products worn on the face that provide varying degrees of protection to the wearer and have the potential to filter respiratory secretions from the wearer to help prevent disease transmission to others (i.e., they may provide source control). Many public health agencies worldwide are encouraging their citizens to wear masks when in public spaces in order to reduce the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. However, there remain notable barriers that reduce overall mask usage. These barriers include issues such as contact dermatitis with prolonged wear, physical discomfort, fogging of eyeglasses, and difficulty communicating. In addition, many masks that are currently available tout unconfirmed protective capabilities that lack scientific evidence to support such claims. Overall, there is a need to develop better designs, materials, and technologies that are more acceptable to wearers and that ensure quantified measures of performance.</p>\n\n<p>To address these issues and accelerate the development of the next generation of masks, BARDA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have partnered to launch the Mask Innovation Challenge: Building Tomorrow’s Mask. NIOSH is part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NIOSH is responsible for conducting research and making recommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. The Mask Innovation Challenge aims to improve the comfort, utility, and protective capabilities of products that are worn during day-to-day activities by the general public when physical distancing is not possible. This competition is designed to support the development of mask designs that meet defined performance standards while also overcoming barriers to use.</p>\n\n<p>The Mask Innovation Challenge seeks to develop innovative and effective designs for mass-producible, low-cost-per-use devices to be worn by the general public in order to provide protection from respiratory disease pathogens. Furthermore, users of these devices should be able to put them on and wear them without extensive fitting procedures or complicated user instructions. Barriers that reduce compliance with mask usage include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Currently available retail devices are often untested, with unknown protective capability.</li>\n  <li>Physical discomfort with use, particularly in hot and humid environments.</li>\n  <li>Contact dermatitis with extended wear.</li>\n  <li>Inability to effectively communicate with others using facial expressions.</li>\n  <li>Speech intelligibility.</li>\n  <li>Lack of understanding of the device’s features.</li>\n  <li>Fogging of eyeglasses during use.</li>\n  <li>Difficulty finding a device that is the proper size.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Structure and Timeline:</strong> The challenge will run for a minimum of 6 months and will be divided into two phases, followed by a possible third phase. All respondents are eligible for Phase 1. Participation in Phase 2 is not dependent upon participation in Phase 1; however, winners from Phase 1 will be eligible to receive additional points for consideration in the final judging process for Phase 2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Design</strong> – Respondents will be asked to submit their concepts for a redesigned mask according to the stipulations in this announcement. Up to 40 regional winners (within up to 4 regions) will be selected to move on to the DRIVe Accelerator Network Product Pitch Competition, where they will present their design to a panel of federal and non-federal experts. Of those finalists, up to 10 will be selected to receive the final prize of up to $10,000 each to create a prototype of their concept. Prototypes and physical products will not be tested in Phase 1, but may be eligible for consideration in future phases.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Innovation Tracks:</strong></p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <p><strong>Masks:</strong> Designs in this track focus on improving upon already existing designs for masks</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>Masks that are selected for testing in future phases may be evaluated against the following criteria:</p>\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>Achieve filtration efficiency ≥20% against a sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosol challenge with a count median diameter of 75 ± 20 nm and a geometric standard deviation of 1.86 at a flowrate of 85 ± 4 Lpm. If the specimen lies flat in the filter holder, the flowrate will be adjusted to achieve a face velocity of 10 cm/sec.</li>\n              <li>Achieve inhalation airflow resistance of ≤15 mm H2O at a flowrate of 85 ± 4 Lpm. If the specimen lies flat in the filter holder, the flowrate will be adjusted to achieve a face velocity of 10 cm/sec.</li>\n              <li>Ability to reduce inward leakage of particles into the breathing zone across the interface of the device and the face. The testing may be performed using people or a manikin headform.</li>\n              <li>Other criteria as deemed necessary in later phases.</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <p><strong>Other Designs/Technologies:</strong> Designs in this track incorporate new technologies and materials that have not yet been included in current mask designs.</p>\n\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>Designs may be judged on an individual basis in future phases by performance testing of prototypes. Because designs may be innovative, new test methods and criteria may need to be developed to evaluate:</p>\n\n            <ul>\n              <li>Filtration efficiency.</li>\n              <li>Inhalation airflow resistance.</li>\n              <li>Ability to reduce inward leakage of particles into the breathing zone across the interface of the device and the face.

Finalists will be invited to submit prototypes for proof-of-concept testing by NIOSH laboratories and other partner laboratories. More details on Phase 2 will be provided by an update to this announcement in the future.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Prize Purse:</strong> Total prize purse of $400,000, divided among 5 winners, to be determined later.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria:</strong> The following concepts will NOT be accepted for consideration for either design track:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Prophylactic chemical treatments that are applied directly to the skin, nose, or throat, such as creams, sprays, coatings, drugs, etc. to provide biocidal enhancement will be excluded due to their potential for skin, eye, and inhalation irritation to the user. Mask designs that incorporate antibacterial or antiviral finishes as a permanent component of their designs may be considered, but should include a description of their safety and toxicology profiles.</li>\n  <li>Contact tracing apps and other behavioral change protocols or technology.</li>\n  <li>NIOSH-approved respirators or designs modifying NIOSH-approved respirators.</li>\n  <li>FDA-cleared masks or modifications to FDA-cleared masks.</li>\n  <li>Products already carrying international respirator certifications (e.g., KN95, P2, P3, etc.) or modifications to these products.</li>\n  <li>A self-contained breathing apparatus or a supplied-air design that would connect to a stationary air source. Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) means that the unit carries its own source of breathing air or oxygen, such as from a tank or generated chemically. A supplied-air respirator connects the wearer’s mask to a stationary tank of breathing air via a hose.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Specifically, they aim to identify and source interoperable, platform agnostic solutions to encourage innovation and economies of scale. Current Army tactical SDRs exhibit 2 proprietary hardware and software integration by a single vendor, which reduces potential waveform innovation and competitive pricing for future enhancements and upgrades. Science and Technology (S&amp;T) intellectual property (IP) providers lack a clear entry point into the Army’s SDR value chain. The Army desires an open hardware architecture that can enable innovative S&amp;T development activities to provide rapid demonstrations of new capabilities. The SDR architecture shall support the integration of waveforms, software solutions, and updates.</p>\n\n<p>OBJECTIVE: Develop a standardized, open hardware architecture (e.g., Software Communications Architecture (SCA), C4ISR Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS), and Modular Open RF Architecture (MORA )) that facilitates the decoupling of hardware and associated software-based waveforms, enabling of multi-vendor solutions, rapid integration of waveforms, and competitive pricing.</p>\n\n<p>CONCEPT WHITE PAPER INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS: The white paper shall discuss the feasibility and assessment of a standardized, open radio hardware architecture that would enable third party (non-original equipment manufacturer (OEM)) waveform developers to easily develop and integrate new waveforms to a radio. The radio architecture should target tactical Army users addressing both mounted (e.g., ground vehicular) and dismounted (e.g., handheld or man portable radios) terrestrial communication applications. The assessment of the architecture should focus on supporting advanced networking waveforms which support voice and data communications. Ideal traits of the hardware architecture and supported waveforms include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>High-degree of scalability (support complex waveforms) and extended communications range.</li>\n  <li>Common commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components, that are readily available and do not require custom manufacturing.</li>\n  <li>Standard design practices, standard interfaces for software, and FieldProgrammable Gate Array (FPGA) development to abstract platform specifics to the greatest extent possible.</li>\n  <li>Use of existing industry standard SDR architectures to the greatest extent possible (e.g., SCA, CMOSS, and MORA).</li>\n  <li>Ability to maximize effective data rate, throughput, and range while operating within established spectrum guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p>15 Mar 2021: Part 1: Concept White Paper submission period open</p>\n\n<p>13 Apr 2021: Part 1: Concept White Paper submission period closed</p>\n\n<p>12 May 2021: Part 1: Concept White Paper winners notified 24 – 28</p>\n\n<p>May 2021: (Tentative) Part 2: Technology Pitches NLT</p>\n\n<p>2 Jun 2021: Part 2: Technology Pitch winners notified</p>\n\n<p>18 Jun 2021: SBIR Phase I and/or D2PhII Proposal submission closed</p>\n\n<p>2 Jul 2021: SBIR Phase I and/or D2PhII award notification</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The US Army, in partnership with US Air Force and US Navy, is announcing its first international tri-service competition, xTechGlobal Artificial Intelligence (AI) Challenge. The xTechGlobal AI Challenge aims to engage with eligible international small to medium enterprises in the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Atlantic Area of Responsibility (AOR), including Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), across the broad spectrum of science and technology to identify capabilities that provide robust, AI-enabled capabilities to manage, integrate, and process disparate data/information sources for rapid decision making.</p>\n\n<p>The US Army Futures Command (AFC)-DEVCOM Atlantic has partnered with Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)), the US Air Force’s AFWERX program and the US Navy Office of Naval Research-Global (ONR-G) to delivery this tri-service competition to an international audience for the first time. The services recognize that the US Department of Defense (DoD) must enhance engagements with eligible international small to medium enterprises, by: (1) understanding the spectrum of ‘world-class’ technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the DoD; (2) integrating the sector of small business innovators into the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem; and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the DoD.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic:</strong> AI-enabled Multi-modal Analytics in Resource Constrained Environments</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Our world is facing a rapid proliferation of data–with more and more data generated from an ever-growing number of data sources. With all of this data comes the promise of better, faster decision making but only if we can properly collect, process, interpret and present that data to those making decisions. The DoD is seeking robust, AI-enabled capabilities to manage, integrate, and process, and reason on disparate data/information sources for rapid decision making. This is particularly challenging due to severe constraints of resources such as computing power and bandwidth at the point of need. Of particular interest are the following AI/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and software tools to enable data analytic capabilities in resource-constrained environments:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>AI-enabled algorithms and services to rapidly assess availability of data and information sources and match the most relevant sources to end users based on user needs and available resources.</li>\n  <li>Multi-modal reinforcement learning algorithms and AI-enabled analytic software tools for disparate data types (e.g., video, over-the-air signals, passive sensor data, and open-source multimedia</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong>\nSubmission Dates for Concept White Papers: March 25, 2021 – May 12, 2021 at 1:00-PM GMT</p>\n\n<p>Final Technology Pitches: September 2021 in London, travel permitting</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The U.S. Army would like to invite interested entities to participate in the xTech</p>\n\n<p>Innovation Combine Advanced Energy Storage Challenge (also referred to as the Innovation Combine) being tentatively held on or around 21-22 July 2021 (subject to change). The Innovation Combine aims to engage with eligible U.S.-based companies and organizations and will provide a forum to collaborate with the Army, earn prize money, and provide potential funding opportunities to tackle Army challenges in Advanced Energy Storage.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Army Futures Command (AFC) has partnered with the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) to deliver this competition. The Army recognizes that it must enhance engagements with eligible U.S.-based companies and organizations by (1) understanding the spectrum of ‘world-class’ technologies being developed commercially that may benefit the Department of Defense (DoD), (2) integrating the sector of commercial innovators into the DoD Science and Technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem, and (3) providing mentorship and expertise to accelerate, mature, and transition technologies of interest to the DoD.</p>\n\n<p>The Innovation Combine is an opportunity for eligible entities (i.e., companies and organizations) to pitch novel advanced energy storage technology solutions directly to the U.S. Army. In addition to non-dilutive cash prizes, entities will have the opportunity to engage with U.S. Army and other partners through information sharing and networking opportunities. The Innovation Combine will provide operational and technical feedback from United States Government (USG) subject matter experts on proposed ideas submitted to this competition and offer the finalists cash prizes and opportunities to participate in the xTech Accelerator to receive education, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help grow their businesses for military and commercial users.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the Innovation Combine is to provide an innovative approach for eligible entities to compete for an award in the accelerating military technology ecosystem by pitching novel advanced energy storage technology solutions directly to the U.S. Army. Topic areas and associated problem statements are listed below. The efforts described in this Announcement are being pursued under the authorities of 10 U.S.C. § 2374a (Prizes for Advanced Technology Achievements) and 10 U.S.C. § 4003 (Prototype Projects) (formerly 10 U.S.C. § 2371b).</p>\n\n<p>The crosscutting topic area of advanced energy storage is important across the U.S. Army and DoD. Given the advancements and complexities of power requirements for Army Soldiers and platforms, proposals submitted to this competition will have interest to various Army research and procurement programs. While the authority of this program is 10 U.S.C. § 2374a, a concept white paper submitted to the Innovation Combine may generate interest by another DoD organization for a funding opportunity outside of this program. The interested DoD organization may contact the submitting entity to provide additional information which may or may not result in partnership opportunities outside of this competition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem Statements</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Innovation Combine aims to accelerate integration of technology prototypes for crucial Army capability gaps into military platforms. Submissions will be open to technology solutions that can considerably improve advanced energy storage by addressing either one or both of the problem statements below and shall meet the definition of a prototype project. A prototype project can generally be described as addressing a proof of concept, model, reverse engineering to address obsolescence, pilot, novel application of commercial technologies for defense purposes, agile development activity, creation, design, development, demonstration of technical or operational utility, or combinations of the foregoing. A process, including a business process, may be the subject of a prototype project.</p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 1: Technologies for Battery Monitoring &amp; Management</em></p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement: The Army seeks new technologies which can be used to provide an accurate estimate of battery system state to various systems or improve management of batteries in air, ground, and soldier platforms. As high energy batteries are integrated onto Army systems to meet increased energy demands, there is a need for technologies that can provide accurate battery parameter estimation or manage multiple batteries on a platform. Some battery parameters to consider include current, open circuit voltage (OCV), and state of charge/health.</p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 2: Safe, Printable, Conformal Batteries</em></p>\n\n<p>Problem Statement: The Army is seeking printable and conformal batteries that can be integrated into parts of weapons, surveillance systems, equipment (such as a helmet, gunstock, uniform/armor), or vehicles, to power features such as night vision, tracking, and tagging. The battery must be able to support 72-hour missions and be conformable to multiple surface types while accounting for safety under different environmental conditions (such as weather and temperature). It must also enable mobility for the Soldier by avoiding the rigid and hermetic seals standard in Li-ion batteries. The proposer needs to select a platform to demonstrate the technology and capability. Upon successful demonstration of the technology at the Soldier-scale, there may be opportunities to explore further development into subsequent applications for robotics and larger platforms.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/assets/netlify-uploads/xtech-innovation-combine_key-dates.png\" alt=\"Key Dates\" /></p>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is announcing the “Mapping Patient Journeys in Drug Addiction Treatment” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to inspire the creation of actionable patient journey maps that might further the understanding of the obstacles that patients face in getting treatment for drug addiction, particularly while our country is in the middle of an ongoing opioid crisis. NIDA invites participants to identify specific points during the patient journey where patients encounter the most difficulty, enabling NIDA to focus new research efforts into alleviating those areas of difficulty in patients’ drug addiction treatment journeys.</p>\n\n<p>The Challenge will offer up to three awards for first, second, and third place entries of $50,000, $30,000, and $20,000 each, respectively. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Subject of the Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>Many health systems, doctors, biomedical researchers, and governments are doing their best to help patients become more engaged in their health. Patients who are informed about their condition and involved in their treatment decisions generally have better health outcomes and incur lower costs.  But what do patients really want? What does their patient journey look like? Is their patient journey more treacherous when it comes to finding treatment for drug addiction?</p>\n\n<p>In the United States, over 20 million people have drug or alcohol addiction – that’s one in seven people. Half of the U.S. population know someone who has previously had or currently has a drug or alcohol addiction. The medical term for a drug addiction is a substance use disorder (SUD). Patients are diagnosed with a specific type of disorder based on the primary substance that they misuse, such as an opioid use disorder, stimulant use disorder, cannabis use disorder, or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder. SUD is a complex but treatable condition. If untreated, it gets worse over time. Doctors determine the severity level of the SUD to help develop the best treatment plan. The higher the severity, the more intensive the level of treatment needed. Most SUD patients are likely to need ongoing treatment and recovery support using a chronic care model for several years. That is, their patient journey will continue for a long time.</p>\n\n<p>What is a patient journey? A patient journey is the ongoing sequence of care events which a patient follows from the point of access into the health system, continuing towards diagnosis and care, and ending in outpatient care or recovery. It can be visualized as an ongoing interaction of care events occurring between the patients and healthcare providers. This journey can include many interconnected activities, ranging from the early education and awareness phase (for example, going online and searching for information about symptoms) to finding a clinic or provider, coming up with insurance or payment, interacting with a physician or other healthcare providers, and finally, appointment follow-ups and reminders for continued care. At the core of health care are the patients and the delivery of services that make them feel safe, comfortable, and ultimately result in improvements to their medical condition. However, for many SUD patients, the health care experience can be challenging, confusing, and inconsistent.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, six phases of the patient journey are defined as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Trigger Event/Awareness:</strong> The patients assess their own symptoms, conduct research, consider potential health conditions that may require treatment, and may even reach out to online communities (e.g., posing questions on social media);</li>\n  <li><strong>Help:</strong> The patient makes initial contact with a health system, including health insurance, via call center, chat, email, mobile, or an in-person visit; </li>\n  <li><strong>Care:</strong> The patient is assessed at a medical facility (e.g., physician’s office, hospital);</li>\n  <li><strong>Treatment:</strong>  The health system provides the patient with both on-site and follow-up care (e.g., prescriptions, physical therapy, counseling, or suggested lifestyle changes);</li>\n  <li><strong>Behavioral/Lifestyle Change:</strong> The patient makes changes to daily routines and takes part in proactive healing in order to reduce readmissions and promote long-term wellbeing;</li>\n  <li><strong>Ongoing Care/Proactive Health:</strong> The patient manages his or her care between clinical visits or admissions; meanwhile, the health system fosters engagement between the patient and physician in order to enable the patient to address symptoms and maintain good health.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Patient journeys are captured in the form of a map. Do you know why it is called a “journey map”? Customer journey mapping is a well-known technique that focuses on determining how customers interact with a particular business. Businesspeople traditionally use customer journey maps to define all of the customers’ steps and to create positive experiences, as this helps to ensure customer satisfaction and leads to repeat business and customer loyalty. Medical professionals are now applying these visual tools, which are so successfully used in business, to health care.  We all know that interacting with the health care system is not as simple as buying a carton of ice cream. Referral forms can go missing, medical office phone systems can be challenging to navigate to make an appointment, waiting times are extended, available beds are difficult to find, the disease or its treatments are long and painful, and most interactions are heightened by the sense of the unknown, fear, uncertainty, and, for SUD, stigma.</p>\n\n<p>Visually mapping the journey allows any organization involved in providing health care to “see” and understand the patient experience by breaking down the management of a condition or treatment into a series of clear steps. These steps could be activities, interactions, or interventions that ultimately create the patient pathway or process of care. When all patient interactions with their healthcare are described as a map of the long treatment journey, that patient experience broadly highlights touchpoints with a healthcare system through the perspective of the real patients — what they think, feel, say, and do. The resulting visual tool incorporates both the physical and emotional journey with the aim of capturing patient obstacles, interactions, and movement through the health care system along with the patient behavior, feelings, motivations, and attitudes across the episodes of care. Journey maps go beyond the static and fixed view by illustrating the relationship between the patient and the healthcare organization as dynamic and changing within the system. They also help to visually convey knowledge and insights around patient experience and promote empathy towards patient groups by placing them at the heart of the healthcare delivery process. By issuing this Challenge, NIDA invites the SUD provider and patient communities to create patient journey maps to distill patient insights and emotions into a concise, visually compelling story of the patient’s experience. If you still have difficulties imagining what this visually compelling story could look like, the examples of traditional ways to visually map patient journeys could be found by simply searching “patient journey map” in your favorite search engine.</p>\n\n<p>Given the complexity and high number of interdependencies that exist within SUD services, NIDA is eager to challenge the SUD provider and patient communities to design patient journey maps that are both comprehensive and accessible. If you are someone with access to, experience with, and knowledge of the SUD patient community, you are invited to create a patient journey map throughout SUD illness to recovery so that NIDA can better understand positive and negative patient interactions with the health system. Examples of the types of people NIDA is encouraging to participate include, but are not limited to: SUD patients, family members, patient advocates, academic researchers, pharmaceutical business development specialists, customer relations managers, marketing agencies, addiction group therapists, social workers from recovery centers, and medical school professors teaching students empathy and inclusion. As patient journey mapping is a way of visualizing and summarizing the service experiences that patients have over time, all from the perspective of the patient, it is very important to have access to the SUD patient population to be able to capture their specific experiences. NIDA is specifically interested in mapping a consecutive series of ‘touch points’ between the patient and SUD services where patient experience is actively shaped. This is because looking at this map enables an organization involved in healthcare, such as NIDA, to uncover the major “pain points”/”aha moments” (e.g. what the organization is doing poorly or that does not meet the patient’s expectations) and opportunities (e.g. what exactly could be done to improve/resolve the pains or create experiences that exceed patient expectation). Often, in patient journey mapping, those “pain points” and “aha moments” are collectively called “moments of truth” (gaps between the desired and the real experience). In turn, knowing and understanding each contact and gap can help healthcare system to create strategic outcomes that improve SUD patient satisfaction and engagement. It will also help to better define where more targeted research efforts can or should occur, improving overall SUD care and outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>How are the patients’ journeys usually created?  Participants (individually or in groups) are asked to split their stories into phases (these can be visualized as sections, chapters, or scenes) to help others understand how the journey changes. Between three and five phases is usually practical from a patient perspective, but it’s advisable to use as many phases as needed. Participants are then asked to describe their overall experience of each phase in more detail. Participants may start this by using a scale from one to ten to rate how satisfied SUD patients felt during each phase, followed by a prompt to describe feelings and emotions associated with each phase, noting these on the journey map. The map should highlight any especially good and bad service experiences in each phase. It is also helpful to analyze the values and actions that led to these positive and negative experiences, with an emphasis on the need to learn from both good and bad experiences. Next, the participants should be asked to think about improvement ideas and suggestions. These can be summarized on the journey map and detailed on separate sheets if more space is needed. If a group of patients contributes to the SUD patient journey mapping, you can take photos of the individual maps and develop a master version integrating all the different versions you have. Start your master map with the all-inclusive draft and then simplify it until key improvements are clearly contextualized in the journey phases and related experiences of patients. This final diagram commonly becomes a central reference for improvement teams and future work. It is important to make sure it is accurate, emotionally rich, and visually simple. Summarize your suggestions for specific improvement opportunities. While this describes a general outline for the patient journey mapping, NIDA challenges the community to be as creative as possible.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<p>•\tChallenge Launch: April 22, 2021\n•\tSubmission Start: April 22, 2021 12:00 AM ET\n•\tSubmission End: September 22, 2021 11:59 PM ET\n•\tJudging Period: September 23, 2021 to October 14, 2021 \n•\tWinners Announced: October 25, 2021</p>\n\n<p><strong>For further information, contact:</strong> <a href=\"NIDAChallenge@nih.gov\">NIDAChallenge@nih.gov</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Institute’s Authority to Conduct the Challenge:</strong> NIDA is conducting this Challenge under the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (COMPETES) Reauthorization Act of 2010, as amended [15 U.S.C. § 3719].

They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes. Participants found to be ineligible for cash prizes may still be publicly recognized. In the event that the prize award normally allotted to the place or rank of an ineligible participant occurs, the cash prize will be awarded to the next eligible participant in the series or ranking. Individuals on the denied persons list or from entities or countries sanctioned by the United States Government are not eligible to participate.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"competition-scenarios\"><strong>Competition Scenarios</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong><em>Order:</em></strong> A list of parts and their goal location on a tray.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Part:</em></strong> One element of an order.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Tray:</em></strong> A surface that hold parts.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Kit:</em></strong> A tray and set of parts that make up an order.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>ARIAC requires participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that are based around building kits made up of particular parts. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the work environment section.</p>\n\n<p>There are three different test scenarios that all involve moving parts from a supply location to a tray. The possible supply locations are a conveyor belt, and stationary bins. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Scenario 1: Baseline Kit Building</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first scenario is intended as a baseline set of tasks for the other test methods to be compared against. The task for this scenario is to pick specific parts and place them on a tray. The robot arms will receive an “Order” that details the list of parts and their target locations. Orders are covered in more detail in the Orders section.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Scenario 2: Dropped Part</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The task for Scenario 2 is identical to Scenario 1, however one or more parts will drop from the robots’ gripper. The robots will need to recover after dropping a part and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped part or fetching a new part.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Scenario 3: In-Process Kit Change</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While the robots are in the middle of assembling a kit, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robots will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</p>\n\n<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials: 5 trials of each of the 3 scenarios. Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Environment</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Simulation environment is a representation of an industrial kitting work cell and assembly workstations. One robot arm on a linear rail, one robot on a gantry system, a conveyer belt, parts bins, trays, and assembly stations.\nThe conveyor belt is a <strong>1 m wide</strong> plane that transports objects across the work environment at a fixed speed of roughly <strong>0.2 m/s</strong>. Parts continuously appear on the belt for the duration of the trial. When parts reach the end of the conveyor belt they are automatically removed. Teams can control the conveyor belt during development, but not during the final competition.</p>\n\n<p>There are eight part bins that may be used for building kits. Parts in these bins will not be replaced once used.</p>\n\n<p>There are two robot arms; one mounted on a single base on a linear actuator that runs parallel to the conveyor belt, the other mounted hanging from a two-dimensional gantry that operates both parallel and perpendicular to the conveyor belt. The Linear actuator measures 4 m.</p>\n\n<p>Four Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV) are located along the Linear actuator. Kits are built on top of these AGVs. A team will programmatically signal the AGVs when the kits are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV will depart for the indicated Assembly Station.</p>\n\n<p>The trays used for assembling kits are flat trays measuring <strong>0.5 x 0.7 m</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Robot Arm</strong></p>\n\n<p>The two robot arms used in each trial will be Universal Robots UR10.</p>\n\n<p>The Robot arms’ positions are controlled through the linear actuator or gantry on which they are mounted.</p>\n\n<p>The end of the arms are equipped with a vacuum gripper. The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sensors</strong></p>\n\n<p>A Participant can place sensors around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score.</p>\n\n<p>A sample of available sensors may include:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Break beam: reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li>\n  <li>Laser scanner: provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li>\n  <li>Cognex logical camera: provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li>\n  <li>Proximity: detects the range to an object.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Order</strong></p>\n\n<p>An order is an instruction containing kits for the robot system to complete.</p>\n\n<p>Each order will specify the kit to be assembled, i.e. the list of parts to be put in the kit.</p>\n\n<p>Each specified part has the following structure:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The type of part.</li>\n  <li>The position and orientation of the part on the tray.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Faulty parts</strong></p>\n\n<p>Above each AGV is a quality control sensor that detects faulty parts. If faulty parts are detected while teams are filling trays, those parts should be removed from the tray and replaced with another part of the same type. Faulty parts are considered unwanted parts: they will not count for any points when the kit is submitted, and they will cost teams the all-parts bonus if left in trays.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Competition process</strong></p>\n\n<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>The robots programmatically signal that they are able to begin accepting orders.</li>\n  <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robots.</li>\n  <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li>\n  <li>In the case of the Dropped Part testing method, up to three parts will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li>\n  <li>In the case of the In-Process Kit Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li>\n  <li>The robots signal programmatically when a kit is complete and ready for quality control.</li>\n  <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"terms-and-conditions\">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong></p>\n\n<p>Other than as set forth herein, NIST does not make any claim to ownership of your entry or any of your intellectual property or third party intellectual property that it may contain.

            "judging": "<h4 id=\"judging-panel\"><strong>Judging Panel</strong></h4>\n\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"basis-on-which-finalists-and-winners-will-be-selected\">Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</h4>\n\n<p>A qualifier will be performed approximately one month before the finals. The automated metrics described below will be used in the qualifier to determine which team(s) progress to the finals.  As described in the Judging Criteria below, these same automated metrics will also be used in the finals, in conjunction with the judging panel.</p>\n\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant’s final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cost Metrics</strong></p>\n\n<p>The following values are calculated for a Participant’s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials.</p>\n\n<p>The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The final cost for individual sensors will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the Finals. For planning purposes, Participants should use the values laid out on the Event Website: <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition\">nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be compared to the baseline cost set by the competition administrators (which will be announced on the Event Website: <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/agile-robotics-industrial-automation-competition\">nist.gov/ariac</a>) and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as TC, and the baseline cost is designated as BC. The cost factor, is then calculated as:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_costformula.png\" alt=\"Cost Formula \" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Completion Score</strong></p>\n\n<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the kit trays contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations and colors, if applicable); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>\n\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the box. The completion score, CS, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the box. For each part that is the correct color (if applicable), an additional 1 point is awarded. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the box, of the correct color (if applicable), and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order kj with i products in it would have a maximum score of 4i points.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Efficiency Factor</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first kit is completed and is designated as T01. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, Ti is counted in seconds from the time that the ith order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times across the teams (ATi) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_efficiencyfactorformula.png\" alt=\"Efficiency Factor formula\" /></p>\n\n<p>If a team’s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.</p>\n\n<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, h, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final h value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong></p>\n\n<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_fullscoreformula.png\" alt=\"Score calculation\" /></p>\n\n<p>For the trials where there is no second, higher priority, order, the following modifications are used: CSK2 = CSK1 , EF2 = 0. This results in the simplified scoring equation:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/ariac_simplifiedscoreformula.png\" alt=\"Score calculation formula when trial had no priority order\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Final Rank Score Calculation</strong></p>\n\n<p>The final rank score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Kit Building, Dropped Part, and In-Process Kit Change scenarios, among others.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Winners:</strong> The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\n\n<p>For each entry, the Judges will receive the video output for each competition trial run in the simulated environment, along with the description of the agility challenges that were being tested in each trial. The Judges will not receive the automated scores that are generated as part of each ARIAC trial.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"judging-criteria\">Judging Criteria</h4>\n\n<p>Each Judge will provide a single score per entry, out of 20 total points, based on the Judging Criteria listed below. This score should provide an overall impression of the entire entry across all trials. Each Judge will provide their score independently to the Challenge Manager, Craig Schlenoff, without interaction with other Judges. The average of these three scores will be added to the points from the automated score to determine the competition winner. In the event of a tie score (or scores), the Challenge Manager will convene the three judges to determine winners by consensus.</p>\n\n<p>The overall score will be broken down as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Overall Score:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Overall Performance based on the automated scoring metrics described above (80 points): Using the automated scoring metrics described herein, the first-place entry will be awarded 80 points, the second-place entry will be awarded 70 points, the third-place entry will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Average of Judge Scoring (20 points): The judges will provide a total score of 20 points, broken down as follows:</p>\n\n    <ol>\n      <li>Novelty/Innovativeness: Approach taken develops new techniques to advance industry robot agility (Up to six points)</li>\n      <li>Ability for Industry to Implement: Approach taken can reasonably be applied by industry to solve similar challenges. (Up to six points)</li>\n      <li>Alignment with the Spirit of the Competition: Approach taken provides a practical and realistic approach that directly addresses the stated goals of the ARIAC Competition. (Up to eight points)</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>NIST will announce the Finalists via the Event Website as well as those Finalists that have been awarded a cash award (each, an “Award”). The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in these rules; however, NIST is not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserves the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Participants meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on NIST’s sole discretion. Using the Judging Criteria described herein, three qualified Judges (appointed by the NIST Director) will determine the winners of the ARIAC Prize Competition.</p>\n\n<p>The winner verification process for being eligible to receive an Award includes providing the full legal name, tax identification number or social security number, routing number and banking account to which the prize money can be deposited directly. Return of any notification as “undeliverable” will result in disqualification. The verification form must be returned within seventy-two (72) hours of receipt. After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of electronic funds transfer addressed to the Official Representatives specified in the winning entries. That Official Representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an entry through that representative. The list of entries receiving Awards for the Competition, including the names of all members of a team, will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>\n\n<p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>\n\n<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition entries are to be borne by Participants.</p>\n",

            "description": "\n<p>The U.S. Army would like to invite interested business entities and academic institutions to participate in the xTech Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office (RCCTO) Army Strategic Rapid Acquisition (AStRA) competition (RCCTO Innovation Day 3) being conducted between April and July 2021.  xTechRCCTO AStRA aims to engage with eligible large and small U.S.-based companies and organizations and will provide a forum to collaborate with the Army, earn prize money, and provide potential funding opportunities to tackle Army technology gaps for both Program Executive Officer (PEO) for Intelligence Electronic Warfare &amp; Sensors (PEO IEW&amp;S) and PEO Soldier RCCTO.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Army’s RCCTO has partnered with Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology) (ASA(ALT)) to deliver this competition to quickly target, acquire, demonstrate, test, and ultimately field promising new technology.  xTechRCCTO AStRA will provide an opportunity for both traditional and nontraditional large and small business entities to submit their innovative technology solutions and prototypes that meet Army’s needs.  xTechRCCTO AStRA will also provide Army experts with an opportunity to evaluate these disruptive, innovative approaches and technologies to address critical capabilities required by the U.S. Army.</p>\n\n<p>RCCTO’s mission is to rapidly and efficiently research, develop, prototype, test, evaluate, procure, transition, and/or field critical enabling technologies and capabilities that address near-term and mid-term threats. RCCTO executes this mission consistent with the Army’s modernization priorities that maximize Soldiers’ capabilities to deploy, fight, and win on future battlefields. The U.S. Army faces an ever more lethal and disruptive battlefield requiring quick acquisition of innovative capabilities to prototype and deliver to the warfighter. xTechRCCTO AStRA is an opportunity for eligible businesses to pitch their novel technology solutions and prototypes directly to the U.S. Army.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n\n<p>The purpose of xTechRCCTO AStRA is to deliver an innovative approach and prototype to compete for an award to accelerate military technology and fill critical technology and operational gaps for the U.S. Army.  This acquisition initiative will enable eligible organizations to respond with proposals that clearly articulate their prototype ideas and demonstrations and how they will satisfy the U.S. Army’s technology and operational gaps as identified in the Problem Statements below. A further goal is to incentivize industry participation by paying business innovators, at least partially, for some of their proposal preparation efforts and costs.  RCCTO is focused on finding mature solutions that could provide combat prototype capability that can be in the hands of Warfighters within a one-to-three-year timeframe.  The expected period of performance (POP) for prototypes and demonstrations that address the Problem Statements is approximately 18 to 24 months.  RCCTO has a total budget of up to $25M of Budget Activity (BA) 6.5 funding (i.e., targeting System Development and Demonstration) for this acquisition; therefore, proposed solutions must deliver an expected outcome of Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 7+ in order to advise capabilities to Warfighters and be able to transition to a Program of Record. Based on the $25M funding limitation, RCCTO expects to award a series of 1 to 8 contracts or Other Transaction Authority (OTA) agreements, but may award more, less, or none based on funding and mission requirements.\nThis competition aims to drive business participation and promote entrepreneurship by awarding prize money for eligible companies or organizations to pitch their novel technology solutions and prototypes. This acquisition follows and complies with all applicable laws and federal/DOD acquisition regulations.  Any awards under the AStRA program are considered “competitive” in accordance with (IAW) both 10 USC 127 and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102 (d) ii.  To encourage commercial solutions, the acquisition process and awards will also follow the guidance of Class Deviation 2018-O0016 under the auspices of Public Law (PL) 114-329, Section 879 of the 2017 NDAA.  Prize monies are authorized and will be “merit-based” and paid IAW 10 USC 2374a (Prizes for Advanced Technology Achievements) and 10 U.S.C. § 2371b (Prototype Projects).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem Statements</strong></p>\n\n<p>xTechRCCTO AStRA aims to accelerate integration of technology prototypes for crucial Army capability gaps and specific problems into military platforms and will target mature programs/projects with exit TRL of 7+.  Submissions will be open to technology solutions that can clearly articulate how the proposal/prototype addresses and solves one of the problem statements outlined below:</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>PEO IEW&amp;S Problem Statements</em></strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Multifunction Antenna for Medium Altitude Air Platform</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> As the Army modernizes to meet Large Scale Combat Operations (LSCO) and Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), it needs its aerial sensors to do more with less. Multifunction antennas are not a new concept, but with recent technological advances, the Army believes there may be commercial solutions available to expand current capabilities. The Army is looking for a millimeter-wave multifunction RF system to find, fix, and track moving targets using low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf or mature technology on a Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained platform. The frequency goal is 18-50 GHz while maximizing the number of concurrent operating modes. Primary modes include Air/Ground Moving Target Indication (AMTI/GMTI) radar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging, Electronic Support/Attack (ES/EA), and ship-to-ship communications. Secondary modes include terrain following and reach-back communications. The design needs to consider both ground and airborne targets.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Enhanced Sensor to Shooter Support with Manpackable Edge Device Enabled by Federated Learning</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The Army is interested in leveraging commercial satellite sensors (Electro-optical, RF, Thermal, etc.) in order to reduce the sensor to shooter timeframe and enhance the warfighters’ ability to identify and assess objects of interest. This capability will be utilized in tactical, forward deployed environments as a component of large-scale combat operations in the Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node (TITAN) system. As such, it must be light weight, easily maneuverable, and quickly concealable (e.g., in a Manpack form factor).  This solution will utilize the most efficient and effective methods for assessing, compiling, and presenting data as actionable information.  This will be accomplished by employing both traditional computing and display techniques augmented by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and/or machine vision paired with enhanced visualizations such as 3D, Augmented Reality (AR), or Virtual Reality (VR) as appropriate.  As part of this effort, the Army is also interested in Federated Learning (FL). Currently, the Army utilizes centralized machine learning (ML) approaches to train models which require significant upfront investments in data annotation and model training that are often time consuming and expensive. These centralized approaches involve data pipelines that use central servers that host trained models to make predictions. The downside of these approaches is that all the data collected by edge devices/sensors is sent back to the central server for retraining, and subsequently returned back to edge devices. This round-trip limits a model’s ability to learn in real-time, increases latency, cost and engineering complexity when applied in Delayed/Disconnected, Intermittently-Connected, Low-Bandwidth (DIL) environments. In contrast, FL, is an approach that updates models at the edge device itself using local data. These locally trained models are then sent from edge devices back to the central server where they are aggregated before a consolidated and improved ‘global’ model is sent back to the edge devices. Using FL, all data is kept in local storage on edge devices and only model weights are exchanged between edge devices and the central server – enabling models to learn in real-time. This decentralized ML approach significantly reduces latency, network/bandwidth requirements and retraining costs. Additionally, since data is kept on local devices this approach simplifies and reduces data security/privacy risks common across edge systems.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence/Automation for Dynamic Cyber Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) Mission Planning and Execution at the Tactical Edge.</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The Army, leveraging Modular Open System Approaches (MOSA) technologies such as Cyber/EW Modular Open Suite of Standards (CMOSS), will be bringing new levels of flexibility to the Battlefield in support of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO). Platforms such as the Tactical Cyber Equipment CMOSS Chassis, Terrestrial Layer System (TLS), and Multi-function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) will be able to deploy disparate and concurrent CEMA capabilities that previously required a greater number of individually sustained systems delivering singular capabilities. As the number of hosted capabilities grows, the ability to dynamically plan and reprogram missions and capabilities based on situational awareness on tactical edge node devices will become readily apparent.   The Army is interested in software and algorithms, hardware/software systems, and machine learning/artificial intelligence/automation solutions capable of processing tactical node sensor data in real time to dynamically plan or reprogram disparate CEMA capabilities provide to achieve the desired effects on the Battlefield.  The Army is particularly looking for novel solutions capable of executing in resource constrained environments (low SWaP dismounted systems) to provide these capabilities.  The Army will also explore proof of concepts and prototype solutions with the goal of incorporating these technologies into the above or future Programs of Record.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong><em>PEO Soldier Problem Statements</em></strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Energy Storage, Power Management, Distribution, and Generation Capabilities - Novel Battery Chemistries and Technologies</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> The single most common piece of feedback any piece of electronic piece of equipment gets is to run for longer. This is especially true for nano Unmanned Aerial Systems (&lt;150g) that are inherently limited in duration due to the physics of flight. The Army is looking for new battery chemistries and technologies that significantly increase the energy density in these small form factors.  Batteries should allow for easy swapping into currently fielded systems (but specialized chargers are acceptable). Sufficient cycle life (&gt;150 charge discharge cycles) is a minimum requirement.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Data and Processing - Edge Processor Aided Target Recognition Solutions</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Robotics and Autonomous Systems are changing the character of warfare at an astonishing pace.  Small Units are increasingly left behind as advances in computing, sensors and algorithms become burdensome for the dismounted Soldier.  The Army is looking for aided target recognition solutions that can operate on edge processors that can identify targets of potential interest including personnel, vehicles, common weapons, and ground hazards.  Solutions that can process both electro-optical and infrared imagery (VGA class) and ideally exploit both simultaneously to operate over more operational conditions are most appealing.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Topic:</strong> Low Size, Weight and Power Cross Domain Solution Device</p>\n\n    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Within the digital framework, Fire Supporters End User Device (EUD) operates on the “Fires Net” which is classified Secret. The Maneuver, which the Fire Supporter is supporting and co-located with, also has an EUD but theirs are Secure But Unclassified (SBU). Due to the different classification levels a Cross-Domain Solution (CDS) is required.  Currently, due to SWaP limitations, there are limited CDSs echelons above the forward located Maneuver and Fire Support assets.  Digital information must travel from an Infantry Soldier, up the Maneuver digital chain until it reaches a CDS, then back down the Fires digital chain until it gets to the Forward Observer. This process results in stale information and requires additional time to clear and process digital fires.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>28 April 2021:Phase 1 - Technical White Paper submission period open</li>\n  <li>25 May 2021: Phase 1 - Technical White Paper submission period closed.

Currently, Federal agencies are conducting IT acquisitions independently and there is not a platform to share best practices, lessons learned, and expertise across the entire federal government. Furthermore, agencies pay varying amounts for the same IT products and services, conduct redundant acquisition activities, and enter agreements with different terms and conditions. In order to fully realize the benefits of coordinated buying approaches like category management, federal agencies need a shared voice to engage with the vendor community and effectively promote two-way communication and ongoing collaboration with IT vendors and suppliers, to include large and small businesses, throughout the acquisition lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Questions</strong>: Of particular interest are epic ideas that address the following challenge questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>What mechanisms (i.e., tools, practices) can be used or created to engage industry in open, ongoing, and transparent dialogue about procurement issues and challenges?</li>\n  <li>How can the federal government effectively co-create requirements with industry?</li>\n  <li>How can we strengthen vendor and supplier relationships?</li>\n  <li>How can we improve communication with industry?</li>\n  <li>How can we promote a diverse federal IT marketplace?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<p>This EPIC challenge will remain open until June 30, 2021.</p>\n",

The NetANTX Challenge, hereinafter referred to as the “Challenge”, is focused on quickly identifying operationally relevant innovations and emerging networking technologies, which are critical to retaining and progressing Naval overmatch in the maritime domain. Selected participants will be invited to demonstrate candidate technologies in an integrated rapid innovation laboratory (iRIL), which is a simulation-based environment (SBE) that will employ tactically-relevant scenarios in operationally-relevant conditions. The iRIL and assessment criteria will focus on technologies that contribute specifically to the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) network layer or layer 3. The OSI model defines the functionality of the network layer as structuring and managing multi-node network, including addressing, routing, and traffic engineering (https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.220-198811-S/en). Solutions are expected to run on a Linux (Centos7) platform, with potentially multiple Ethernet interfaces. Solutions are expected to control how application packets are forwarded, queued or dropped on a per-packet or per-flow basis. Technologies that operate above layer 3 (e.g. Application layer routing protcols), but manipulate the routing tables or capture and redirect traffic to interfaces are within scope. Solutions that leverage Software Defined Networking (SDN) technologies or Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (MANET) solutions are both encouraged.</p>\n\n<p>Future prize challenges will focus on the other OSI layers (application through physical layers) and/or technology areas which include, but are not limited to: modern software development pipelines and infrastructure, underlying data architectures, and rapid deployment of automation, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) into tactical applications both afloat and ashore.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"problem-statement\">Problem Statement</h4>\n\n<p>Consider a scenario where the Naval Force is operating in a highly contested environment and most communication paths are denied. In this scenario, only a few modes and links that operate at low kilobit per second data rates and below. Such a network is characterized by:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>sparsely connected nodes</li>\n  <li>multi-hop needed to support end-to-end application flows</li>\n  <li>low kilobit per second data rate links</li>\n  <li>dynamic and unpredictable connectivity based on locations and radio frequency (RF) channel effects</li>\n  <li>network demand exceeds available network resources</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each of the above conditions poses a significant challenge to network operation. Yet, the Navy must operate under the combined effects of all the above conditions. The Networks Prize Challenge, hereinafter referred to as the “Challenge”, seeks innovative technologies that will maximize the utility of this very limited network, specifically by enabling efficient, low-overhead routing of application packets.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge Registration and Submissions Opens<strong>:  June 2021</strong></li>\n  <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/distro_a-ainetantx-30jun21-virtual-live-qa-announcement-and-registration-information.pdf\">Virtual Q&amp;A Session with prospective participants</a>: <strong>June 30, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>White Paper/Quad Chart Deadline: <strong>July 27, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Review/ Down-selection Boards: <strong>August 10 - August 12, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Announce invited AINet ANTX Challenge participants:  <strong>August 24, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Virtual Q/A Session for participants:  <strong>August 31st, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>iRIL Integration Workshop:  <strong>September 14, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Networking Technology Submission:  <strong>October 22, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>NetAI ANTX (Presentation/Demonstration):  <strong>November 4, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Prize Challenge Board Deliberations:  <strong>November 5, 2021</strong></li>\n  <li>Announce Prize Challenge Winners:  <strong>November 10, 2021</strong></li>\n</ul>\n",

            "judging": "<p><strong>Assessment Criteria and Simulation Environment</strong></p>\n\n<p>We seek innovative technologies to optimize networks operating in dynamic, low-capacity environments. This challenge focuses on low overhead routing protocols. Participants should generalize their approaches since all technologies will be tested and evaluated beyond the SBE, in higher fidelity and operationally relevant environments. At a minimum, the routing protocol should support User Datagram Protocol (UDP) unicast flows and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flows. Support for UDP multicast is desired, but not necessary for this challenge. In the following sections we describe the assessment criteria and the provided SBE.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria – Networks Prize Challenge Invitations</strong></p>\n\n<p>Conforming white paper and quad chart submissions will be evaluated by a panel of qualified networking experts using the following criteria which is in descending order of importance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Operational impact of the technology/engineering innovation in the intended mission scenarios and operational environment</li>\n  <li>Estimated technical performance (weighted network goodput; network overhead; end-to-end network latency) of the technology/engineering innovation</li>\n  <li>Integration complexity of the technology/engineering innovation</li>\n  <li>Technical maturity of the technology/engineering innovation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When conducting the assessment, the Government reserves the right to take other significant factors as required into consideration, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Limitations to use due to Intellectual Property ownership</li>\n  <li>Ease of fielding the technology in existing legacy Naval platforms (e.g. solution that requires many large software dependencies or are require significant compute/memory resources, or that run on very specific hardware architectures would be viewed less favorably).</li>\n  <li>Required out-of-band information needed for the networking technology to operate</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on this initial assessment of the white papers and quad charts, participants will be invited to participate in the Challenge. Selected participants will be notified via email communication and will receive invitations to the Challenge question and answer (Q&amp;A) Sessions and iRIL Integration Workshops.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assessment Criteria – Networks Prize Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>Challenge participants will be evaluated throughout iRIL Integration Workshops and Challenge demonstrations by a panel of qualified networking experts and using the following criteria which is in descending order of importance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Operational impact of the technology/engineering innovation in the intended mission scenarios and operational environment</li>\n  <li>Technical performance – Network Overhead</li>\n  <li>Technical performance – Total network goodput</li>\n  <li>Technical performance – Average End-to-end latency and network convergence time after topology changes</li>\n  <li>Integration complexity of the technology/engineering innovation</li>\n  <li>Technical maturity of the technology/engineering innovation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Goodput is defined as the fraction of available capacity that is used to deliver application traffic, and implicitly factors in the overhead consumed by the routing protocol.</p>\n\n<p>End-to-end latency is defined as the average transit time of packets for the duration of a flow over the network.</p>\n\n<p>Network convergence time is defined as the time taken to successfully route a packet after a network topology change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>iRIL Simulation Environment</strong></p>\n\n<p>Participants will be provided a virtual machine (VM) which contains the SBE. The iRIL uses a group of Linux containers connected to a network simulator, hosted on a virtual machine (VM). The test scenario will be scripted in the simulator, which will determine connectivity, link latency and link loss rates at any given time. Participants do not need a detailed understanding of the network simulator beyond how to start, stop and reset the scenario. The simulator will provide real-time feedback about the network connectivity and performance metrics. This feedback is for ease of observability and should not be used by the routing technology.</p>\n\n<p>Submitted technologies must be compatible with Linux Centos7 which will host the network simulator. Technologies will be run within Centos7 containers in the VM. The operating systems will have the following additional user software installed as a baseline:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Free Range Routing (FRR)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The routing agents must be Linux VM compatible (e.g., a GUI, console, or powershell using standard Linux installation procedures). Documentation inclusive of installation procedures should also be provided when submitting the tool, in accordance with the tool submission guidelines provided above. Participants may install additional software within the containers, as long as it is included in the submission package.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the scenario will contain a set of application traffic flows that will start and stop automatically as the scenario progresses.</p>\n\n<p>The iRIL platform used at AINet ANTX includes monitoring, visualizations and metrics tracking, and participants do not need to dedicate resources to provide this functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Technologies that require specific hardware, proprietary components, or on-premises management appliances or consoles will not be considered.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Prize Award Details</strong></p>\n\n<p>Winners will be announced at the conclusion of the Challenge event. NAVWAR will also announce the winners on the Challenge.gov website, the NAVWAR LinkedIN page, media outlets, and social media channels.</p>\n\n<p>NAVWAR has established $100,000 as the total amount set aside for cash prizes under this Challenge. A $75,000 first place cash prize will be awarded to the winning entry. A $25,000 second place cash prize will also be awarded. In the unlikely event of a tie, NAVWAR will determine an equitable method of distributing the cash prizes. In the event that an entity ineligible of receiving the cash award wins first and/or second place, NAVWAR will determine the equitable method of distributing the cash prizes.</p>\n\n<p>If a prize goes to a team of participants, NAVWAR will award the cash prize to the individual/team’s point of contact registered via the challenge website, for further distribution to the team, as the team members see fit.</p>\n\n<p>NAVWAR is executing two simultaneous but independent prize challenges the AINet ANTX. This prize challenge announcement, and the details within, refer specifically to the Networks Prize Challenge. A companion prize challenge, titled the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Prize Challenge, has been announced separately on Challenge.gov.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Over 1.5 million Americans are prescribed supplemental oxygen for use outside the hospital for a range of medical conditions. Although there are different options available for how outpatients receive supplemental oxygen, the issues associated with the therapeutic goals and optimal use of home oxygen continue to be considered and are not considered solved. Patients consistently express concerns around the following issues particularly: having an oxygen supply be lighter and more portable, making it last longer, and ensuring that they get the amount (“flow rate”) that is needed.</p>\n\n<p>To address these issues, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is sponsoring the Air You Wear Challenge - a two phase challenge with a total prize purse of $500,000 to help teams with compelling ideas to develop and demonstrate proof of concept for their innovative approaches for providing supplemental oxygen to outpatients, while promoting activity in the field and awareness of this problem to the wider community. The NHLBI is interested in providing more supplemental oxygen options to outpatients. Proposed approaches can be for new devices, modifications to existing technologies, or something else entirely.</p>\n\n<p>The goal of this challenge is to broadly stimulate research and development of processes and technologies that actively address the different outpatient issues associated with use of supplemental oxygen. People who use supplemental oxygen and their loved ones are anxious for new options that are lighter, more portable, longer-lasting, and capable of providing the required oxygen level (flow-rate). If you have actionable ideas for how to improve the portability, flow rate, or duration of home oxygen supplies, the NHLBI wants to hear about them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Challenge launch: June 22, 2021</li>\n  <li>Phase 1 competition period: June 22, 2021 - September 30, 2021</li>\n  <li>Phase 1 submissions due: September 30, 2021</li>\n  <li>Phase 1 judging: September - November 2021</li>\n  <li>Phase 1 winner(s) announced: December 2021</li>\n  <li>Phase 2 development period: November 30, 2021 - July 14, 2022</li>\n  <li>Phase 2 submissions due: July 14, 2022</li>\n  <li>Phase 2 judging: July - September 2022</li>\n  <li>Phase 2 winner(s) announced: September 2022</li>\n</ul>\n",

The result of the First Responder UAS Triple Challenge 3.3 “Shields Up” will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the Shields Up Challenge is to explore and advance the cybersecurity of UAS technology to support first responders in their missions. The use of UAS expands public safety’s ability to gather critical data, whether they be from video, cameras, sensors, or peripherals, and allows them to obtain this information more quickly and efficiently than deploying boots-on-the-ground.</p>\n\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) Division is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards <strong>up to $200,000</strong> for the top designs. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.

PSCR’s Open Innovation team engages public safety entities, government, academia, and industry to identify innovation opportunities and foster technology advancements for public safety communications through prize competitions and challenges.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"project-objectives\">Project Objectives</h4>\n\n<p>The purpose of the Shields Up Challenge is to explore and advance the cybersecurity of UAS technology to support first responders in their missions. The use of UAS expands public safety’s ability to gather critical data, whether they be from video, cameras, sensors, or peripherals, and allows them to obtain this information more quickly and efficiently than deploying boots-on-the-ground.</p>\n\n<p>Public safety uses a myriad of solutions for their UAS needs, including commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) UAS and open-source/do-it-yourself (DIY) hardware and software. The term UAS applies to many types of aircraft that are being incorporated into public safety missions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Crime scene processing</li>\n  <li>Cross-agency aid</li>\n  <li>Damage assessment (man-made or natural event)</li>\n  <li>Disaster response</li>\n  <li>Fire or explosives</li>\n  <li>Infrastructure inspections</li>\n  <li>Major traffic accident investigations</li>\n  <li>Search and rescue missions</li>\n  <li>Special events or public safety assessments</li>\n  <li>Tactical deployment</li>\n  <li>Terrorism response</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As UAS technology becomes more pervasive in the public safety mission, it will become crucial to protect these assets from disruptions in navigation and control.</p>\n\n<p>The public safety use case for UAS is multifaceted. However, all UAS must maintain controlled flight and successful navigation at their core in order to complete their missions. A UAS that flies to the wrong location or is delayed in reaching a time-crucial objective is as good as a UAS that has not taken flight. A UAS that is hijacked due to a malicious attacker not only jeopardizes public safety missions, it also compromises responder assets. In both of these cases, the compromised UAS causes mission failure.</p>\n\n<p>Contestants in this Challenge are required to frame their threats and countermeasures concerning the disruption and preservation of UAS navigation and control to prevent mission failure:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>UAS Navigation</strong> - The ability of the UAS to successfully move between two points within 3D (three dimensional) airspace.</li>\n  <li><strong>UAS Control</strong> - The ability for a pilot-controlled UAS to successfully maintain flight control within a 3D airspace.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>With the innovative solutions discovered through this Challenge, PSCR seeks to improve UAS cybersecurity for state and local first responders as they deploy UAS for law enforcement, firefighters, and other emergency services. To accomplish this, we seek to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify real-world threats to UAS flight, navigation, and control technologies</li>\n  <li>Identify countermeasures for these threats</li>\n  <li>Demonstrate the threat and countermeasures on a functional UAS.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Contestants are required to demonstrate attacks on open-source software for UAS navigation and/or control. Contestants are encouraged to use innovation and creativity when designing their countermeasures. Possible solutions include but are not limited to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Updates and/or modifications to existing open source software</li>\n  <li>Newly developed software</li>\n  <li>Newly developed hardware</li>\n  <li>Secure UAS configuration guidance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>NOTE: Contestants are required to review the <strong><em><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/3.2-uas3.3-challenge-rules-20210701.pdf\">Official Rules</a></em></strong> for a description of Challenge Areas, Challenge Guidance and Disqualifying Solutions.</p>\n\n<p>PSCR understands the potential for organizations to be developing drones with these or similar capabilities, such as for the DoD; however, these drones are expected to cost more than what a local public safety department might be able to afford. Additionally, they may not be practical due to the difficulty of transporting large equipment and/or the need for specialized training to operate it, both of which can be difficult for city/state agencies with limited staff and resources. Therefore, PSCR is hosting this 3-stage challenge to design, develop, and demonstrate drones with extended flight time and other capabilities that support first responders to help advance the research and push the boundaries of UAS technology for public safety.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"deliverables-due\">Deliverables Due</h4>\n\n<p>Participants will be asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a concept paper using an online form, outlining the UAS knowledge, skills, capabilities and design approach for this challenge.</li>\n  <li>Create or purchase hardware necessary to build a prototype and implement the design approach outlined within the concept paper.</li>\n  <li>Produce a Test flight video demonstrating the UAS prototype capabilities and safety compliance.</li>\n  <li>Participate in a witnessed live technology demonstration at the competitor’s location April 4 – 8, 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"uas-challenge-stages\">UAS Challenge Stages</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/3.3-challenge-stages.jpg\" alt=\"Table providing overview of challenge stages.

PSCR’s Open Innovation team engages public safety entities, government, academia, and industry to identify innovation opportunities and foster technology advancements for public safety communications through prize competitions and challenges.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"operational-use-case\">Operational Use Case</h4>\n\n<p>The number of operational use cases for providing data to first responders in a cellular denied environment is large; however, for the purpose of this contest, we will use a wildland fire scenario as our example. Picture yourself as a wildland firefighter in a remote region. There are multiple other wildland firefighter groups dispersed across a fireline as well as at an incident command post that has been set up away from your location. As time goes on, resources and assets involved in the operation are moving in and around the area. Additionally, the fire is advancing in an unknown direction. It is not entirely clear how the scene is changing from everyone’s perspective. For example, where are the groups of firefighters moving too, where is the current fireline, where are strategic assets such as trucks and heavy machinery, what are the current orders from incident command, etc. A UAS mounted with a broadband transceiver could relay this information between all groups in the field and to the incident command post providing critical situational awareness to everyone involved.</p>\n\n<p>This real-time communications system would provide more than just voice communications. For example, the system could disseminate map information, asset location information, pictures, video, etc. What sort of complete system (UAS &amp; transceiver) could you design to allow for continuous data communications between groups of first responders during a wildland fire? An example could be a UAS equipped with a Wi-Fi system that has multiple antenna beams pointing towards each firefighter group. The UAS must have the ability to maintain communications to each first responder group in the field for as long as possible. Additionally, first responders may be moving in all directions from where the UAS is located, so ensuring that everyone is connected is a top priority.</p>\n\n<p>There are several UAS design features that need to be considered in support of public safety agencies.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The system needs to be cost effective to fit a first responder’s budget.</li>\n  <li>The UAS needs to be easily deployable to operate in degraded launch areas at any time, so the capability of the UAS to have VTOL is necessary.</li>\n  <li>The UAS should be compact since space in a first responder vehicle is often limited.</li>\n  <li>The UAS should be easily pilotable.</li>\n  <li>The system should be able to communicate to all UEs in the area.</li>\n  <li>The system needs to support IP communication between the two end points.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"uas-design-specifications\">UAS Design Specifications</h4>\n\n<p>UAS entered for the LifeLink Challenge will be subject to the requirements outlined in the Design Specifications.  <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-3.2-uas-design-specs.pdf\">Click here for details</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PSCR is aware that various organizations may be developing drones with these or similar capabilities; however, these drones typically cost more than what a local public safety department might be able to afford. Additionally, they may not be practical due to the difficulty of transporting large equipment and/or the need for specialized training to operate it, both of which can be difficult for city/state agencies with limited staff and resources. Therefore, PSCR is hosting this 3-stage challenge to design, develop, and demonstrate drones with extended flight time and other capabilities that support first responders to help advance the research and push the boundaries of UAS technology for public safety.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"deliverables-due\">Deliverables Due</h4>\n\n<p>Participants will be asked to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submit a concept paper using an online form, outlining the UAS knowledge, skills, capabilities and design approach for this challenge.</li>\n  <li>Create or purchase hardware necessary to build a prototype and implement the design approach outlined within the concept paper.</li>\n  <li>Produce a Test flight video demonstrating the UAS prototype capabilities and safety compliance.</li>\n  <li>Participate in a Live Competition, conducting flights in Starkville MS June 22 – 24, 2022.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"usa-challenge-stages\">USA Challenge Stages</h4>\n\n<p><img src=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/3.2-challenge-stages.jpg\" alt=\"Table providing overview of challenge stages.

A common tool that is used to search above treetops, and in large areas, is a UAS with an optical camera. Unfortunately, due to the heavy forest vegetation, traditional optical cameras are ineffective.  What sort of improvements could you make to this system (UAS &amp; sensors) to entirely mitigate or remove the problem created by the foliage? For example, improvements to this UAS SAR system could take the form of thermal imaging sensors, acoustic sensors, air sampling sensors, etc. Additionally, the UAS autopilot could be programmed to fly more effective search patterns through data analytic methods or to move closer to a suspected missing person’s location from sensor inputs. The UAS must have the ability to search for the lost hikers from as far away and as fast as possible.</p>\n\n<p>There are several UAS design features that need to be considered in support of public safety agencies.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The system needs to be cost effective to fit a first responder’s budget.</li>\n  <li>The UAS needs to be easily deployable to operate in degraded launch areas at any time, so the capability of the UAS to have VTOL is necessary.</li>\n  <li>The UAS should be compact since space in a first responder vehicle is often limited.</li>\n  <li>When the UAS runs low on power and needs to land, the process to refuel or recharge the system should be simple to quickly resume flight.</li>\n  <li>The UAS should be easily pilotable.</li>\n  <li>The system should be able to search as fast as possible for all missing persons.</li>\n  <li>The system should be able to identify missing persons from great distances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"uas-design-specification\">UAS Design Specification</h4>\n\n<p>UAS entered for the FastFind Challenge will be subject to the requirements outlined in the design specifications.  <a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-3.1-uas-design-specs.pdf\">Click here for details</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PSCR is aware that various organizations may be developing drones with these or similar capabilities; however, these drones typically cost more than what a local public safety department might be able to afford.

The Challenge mechanism provides an opportunity for on the ground voices to participate in developing novel innovative approaches that can be successfully implemented within their local communities.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"background\"><strong>Background</strong></h4>\n\n<p>HHS OMH is dedicated to improving the health of racial and ethnic minority populations through the development of health policies and programs that help eliminate health disparities. OMH awards and other activities are intended to support the identification of effective policies, programs and practices for improving health outcomes and to promote sustainability and dissemination of these approaches. This effort aligns with other HHS activities, including: (1) HHS Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) strategies to prevent new HIV transmissions and treat people with HIV; (2) recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Minority Health (ACMH) to increase community engagement and reduce stigma to reduce HIV incidence in groups that have been marginalized; (3) National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of AIDS Research and National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Division of AIDS Research workshop on HIV-related intersectional stigma research; (4) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) principles of community engagement that are cornerstones of efforts to improve public health and address health disparities<sup>1</sup>; and (5) the Health Resources and Services Administration’s Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program’s longtime commitment to implementing community engagement activities to improve care for people with HIV.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n<p>PrEP and ART are effective prevention methods against transmission of HIV.<sup>3</sup> PrEP is an HIV prevention method in which people who don’t have HIV take PrEP medicine daily to reduce their risk of acquiring HIV infection if they are exposed to the virus. ART is a combination of medications taken daily that help people with HIV stay healthy by reducing the amount of HIV in their blood and reducing the risk of HIV transmission to others.  Persons with HIV who benefit from HIV treatment are estimated to have similar life expectancies compared  to persons without HIV<sup>4</sup>. Despite the development of HIV prevention and treatment approaches, disparities exist among racial and ethnic minority populations in their utilization of these strategies.</p>\n\n<p>Racial and ethnic minority populations have disproportionately higher rates of new HIV infections and HIV diagnoses, and lower rates of PrEP and ART awareness, initiation and adherence. A  CDC analysis shows that nearly 80 percent of new HIV infections in the U.S. in 2016 occurred from the nearly 40 percent of PWH who either did not know they had HIV, or who had been diagnosed but were not receiving HIV care.<sup>5</sup>  Black persons accounted for 14 percent of the U.S. population but 41 percent of new HIV infections in 2019.<sup>6,7</sup>  The rate of new HIV diagnoses among Black adults is eight times that of White adults and more than twice that of Hispanic/Latino adults. The rate for Black males was four times the rate for Black females. (Hispanic/Latino persons accounted for almost 29 percent of all HIV infection cases in 2019.<sup>8</sup>  American Indian/Alaska Native persons have the highest percentage of estimated diagnoses of HIV infection attributed to injection drug use, compared with all other races/ethnicities.<sup>9</sup> Among persons with HIV, the largest percentage of persons with undiagnosed HIV infection was that among American Indian/Alaska Native persons (20.5%), followed by Hispanic/Latino persons (16.4%), Black/African American persons (13.4%), Asian persons (13.4%), multiracial persons (11.1%), and White persons (10.8%).<sup>10</sup>  The latest estimates indicate that effective HIV prevention and treatment are not adequately reaching those who could most benefit from them.<sup>11</sup>   Although Black persons accounted for approximately 40 percent of persons with PrEP indications, nearly six times as many White persons were prescribed PrEP as were Black persons. Only 26 percent of Black men who have sex with men (MSM) and 30 percent of Hispanic MSM reported taking PrEP within the past year, compared with 42 percent of white MSM.<sup>12</sup></p>\n\n<p>Research indicates that HIV-related stigma is one of the factors that contributes to poor uptake of prevention tools and treatment. HIV-related stigma is rooted in a fear of HIV and is defined as negative attitudes and beliefs about people with HIV.<sup>13</sup> It is the prejudice that comes with labeling an individual as part of a group that is believed to be socially unacceptable. Discrimination related to HIV status often leads to internalized stigma (development of negative self-image) and external stigma (experience of unfair treatment by others). Stigma can lead to feelings of shame, fear of disclosure, isolation, and despair which can keep people from getting tested and treated for HIV.<sup>14</sup> Data on the effects of HIV-related stigma on treatment adherence show that those who had experienced stigma tended to report lower adherence. Lower treatment adherence leads to poor rates of undetectable viral load (amount of HIV in the body so low that a test cannot detect it) in PWH with subsequent increased HIV transmission<sup>15</sup> and can result in drug resistant strains.  The White House Office of National AIDS Policy and the EHE have both identified reduction of stigma as a critical step toward decreasing HIV disparities and reducing barriers to utilization of HIV prevention and treatments.</p>\n\n<p>Community engagement and mobilization have been a priority within HIV prevention strategies and increasingly recognized as vital to expand access to quality care, prevent disease, and achieve health equity. Community-based organizations that serve racial and ethnic minority and other groups that have been marginalized are uniquely positioned to identify and reach racial and ethnic minority individuals at increased risk for HIV and PWH.  Community engagement has been critical to HIV prevention and was a critical part of the development of the EHE.  During the 2019 ACMH Meeting, the ACMH discussed the incorporation of new strategies to engage communities with significant numbers of new HIV infections.  The ACMH also recommended the identification of mechanisms to reduce stigma and discrimination for individuals from racial and ethnic minority populations to maximize HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, increased knowledge and implementation of community engagement and mobilization strategies to support stigma reduction among racial and ethnic minority populations could result in increased initiation of and adherence to PrEP or ART to prevent new infections, reduce HIV transmission and incidence rates, and help PWH achieve and maintain viral load suppression.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"purpose\">Purpose</h4>\n\n<p>OMH is creating a national competition to identify innovative and effective approaches to enhance community engagement and mobilization on the reduction of HIV stigma and disparities.  Desired outcomes include improved utilization of PrEP and ART among racial and ethnic minority PWH or racial and ethnic minorities who are at increased risk for HIV infection. Participants will have access to subject matter experts (SMEs) for group and individual coaching throughout the Challenge phases. This Challenge seeks to achieve its desired outcomes through supporting innovative and effective approaches for racial and ethnic minority populations that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Identify types of stigma to be addressed (e.g., internalized, enacted, anticipated, ageism, racism)</li>\n  <li>Incorporate validated stigma measurement tools (e.g., HIV Stigma Scale, Everyday Discrimination Scale, Intersectional Discrimination Index, Multiple Discrimination Scale, Gendered Racism Scale)</li>\n  <li>Use community engagement and mobilization strategies</li>\n  <li>Increase knowledge and skills in reducing HIV stigma among community-based organizations serving racial and ethnic minorities</li>\n  <li>Evaluate scalability of developed approaches</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"subject-and-scope-of-prize-competition\">Subject and Scope of Prize Competition</h4>\n\n<p>Projects must result in innovative and effective approaches that utilize community engagement and mobilization strategies to reduce stigma related to PrEP and ART within racial and ethnic minority populations. The approaches will be shared with the general public.</p>\n\n<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated, and separate prizes may be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"key-dates\">Key Dates</h4>\n\n<p><strong>Challenge Posting Date:</strong> Thursday, July 22, 2021</p>\n\n<p><strong>Registration Deadline:</strong> Friday, September 24, 2021</p>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 1: Design of Concept</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins: Monday, July 26, 2021</li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Webinar: Thursday, August 19, 2021, 3:00 – 4:00 pm EDT.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/hiv-challenge_webinar_8.18.21.pdf\">View webinar slides (PDF) - click here</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/hiv-challenge-faq_updated-9.2.21.pdf\">View FAQ (PDF) – click here</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/3_Gudbxfx2g\">Webinar Recording- click here</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"{{site.baseurl}}/assets/netlify-uploads/hiv-challenge-submission-checklist_english_9.07.2021.pdf\">View submission checklist (PDF) – click here</a></li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: Thursday, September 23, 2021 11:59 PM EDT</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: October 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 2: Development of Approach</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins: Monday, November 1, 2021</li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: Thursday, March 3, 2022, 11:59 pm EST</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: March 2022</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Phase 3: Refinement of Approach and Small-Scale Testing</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Submission period begins: Monday, March 28, 2022</li>\n  <li>Submission period ends: Thursday, July 14, 2022, 11:59 pm EDT</li>\n  <li>Winners announced: July 2022</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4 id=\"footnotes\">Footnotes</h4>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup><a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/communityengagement/pdf/PCE_Report_508_FINAL.pdf\">https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/communityengagement/pdf/PCE_Report_508_FINAL.pdf </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup><a href=\"https://hab.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hab/Publications/careactionnewsletter/community-engage.pdf\">https://hab.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hab/Publications/careactionnewsletter/community-engage.pdf </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup><a href=\"https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/potential-future-options/long-acting-prep\">https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/hiv-prevention/potential-future-options/long-acting-prep </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>4</sup><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5703840/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5703840/ </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>5</sup><a href=\"https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview#:~:text=Further%2C%20recent%20analysis%20from%20CDC,were%20not%20receiving%20HIV%20care\">https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/ending-the-hiv-epidemic/overview#:~:text=Further%2C%20recent%20analysis%20from%20CDC,were%20not%20receiving%20HIV%20care</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>6</sup><a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20there%20were%2046.8%20million%20people%20who,with%20varied%20racial%20and%20ethnic%20identities%20and%20experiences\">https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/fact-sheet/facts-about-the-us-black-population/#:~:text=In%202019%2C%20there%20were%2046.8%20million%20people%20who,with%20varied%20racial%20and%20ethnic%20identities%20and%20experiences</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>7</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-supplemental-report-vol-26-1.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-supplemental-report-vol-26-1.pdf </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>8</sup>ibid</p>\n\n<p><sup>9</sup><a href=\"https://www.ihs.gov/hivaids/stats/\">https://www.ihs.gov/hivaids/stats/</a></p>\n\n<p><sup>10</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-supplemental-report-vol-26-1.pdf\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/reports/surveillance/cdc-hiv-surveillance-supplemental-report-vol-26-1.pdf </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>11</sup><a href=\"https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics\">https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>12</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6837a2.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6837a2.htm </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>13</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-stigma/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-stigma/index.html </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>14</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-stigma/index.html#:~:text=HIV%20stigma%20is%20negative%20attitudes,of%20people%20can%20get%20HIV\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/hiv-stigma/index.html#:~:text=HIV%20stigma%20is%20negative%20attitudes,of%20people%20can%20get%20HIV </a></p>\n\n<p><sup>15</sup><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/art/index.html</a></p>\n",

Ultimately 20 Finalists will receive awards of $25K each and be invited to demonstrate a proof-of-concept of their dual-use technologies pertaining to Army challenges and have the opportunity to submit for a Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award of up to $250K each. Proof-of-concept demonstrations will take place at or around the 2022 Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Global Force Symposium and Exhibition in March 2022 in Huntsville, Alabama. Details on the prize and SBIR structure are listed below in this announcement.</p>\n\n<p>The xTechSearch competition strives to integrate small businesses into the Army’s S&amp;T ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs, including authorized access to the Army’s organic intellectual and technical capital. Participants will receive detailed feedback from Army and Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholders.</p>\n\n<p>Participants will have access to training, mentorship and other support infrastructure as they progress through the contest to determine how best to align their technology solutions with real users and buyers within the Army. Finalists will be entered into the xTech Accelerator to receive intensive mentorship and access to networking events to help grow their companies for Army and commercial users. xTechSearch is an opportunity for eligible participants to pitch novel technology solutions – a new application for an existing technology or an entirely new technology concept – to the Army.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>30 July 2021</strong> - Part 1: Concept White Paper submission period open</li>\n  <li><strong>2 September 2021</strong> - Part 1: Concept White Paper submission period closed</li>\n  <li><strong>29 September 2021</strong> - Part 2: Technology Pitches invitations sent out</li>\n  <li><strong>25 October – 5 November 2021</strong> - Part 2: Technology Pitch Days</li>\n  <li><strong>5 November 2021</strong> - Part 3: Finalists Announced</li>\n  <li><strong>5 November 2021</strong> – March 2022 - xTechSearch 6 Accelerator</li>\n  <li><strong>March 2022</strong> - Finals held at or around the AUSA 2022 Global Force Symposium</li>\n  <li><strong>March 2022</strong> - Winner Announced</li>\n  <li><strong>April 2022</strong> - SBIR Phase I Proposal Submission Closed</li>\n  <li><strong>May 2022</strong> - SBIR Phase I Award Notification</li>\n</ul>\n",

In a concerted effort to attract truly novel perspectives, this initiative will target covered institutions that have historically received less funding than their counterparts, such as non-Tier 1 (R1) colleges and universities, with the intent to fund institutions that have not otherwise received a significant amount of funding from the DoD Research Development Test and Evaluation (RDT&amp;E) programs.</p>\n\n<p>xTechHBCU will provide a structured and focused entry path for eligible participants to submit novel concepts and technology solutions directly to the U.S. Army and provide opportunities for these participants to become integrated into the Army’s science and technology (S&amp;T) ecosystem by providing research opportunities with Army labs.  Participants will receive detailed feedback from Army and Department of Defense (DoD) stakeholders; and will have access to training, mentorship, networking opportunities and other support infrastructure as they progress through the contest to determine how best to align their research proposals with real Army problems and Users.</p>\n\n<p>xTechHBCU will combine a prize competition with structured opportunities for follow-on research funding awards of up to $150,000. Competitions for cash prize awards will be executed under authorities 10 U.S.C. § 2374a and 10 U.S.C. § 2362. Follow-on opportunities will be left to the discretion of the participating agencies as they have the authority to award a variety of instruments. It is anticipated that up to a maximum of three (3) follow-on awards for up to $150,000 each may be awarded in the form of contracts, grants, cooperative agreements, technology investment agreements (TIAs), or other transactions for prototypes (OTAs). Participating agencies reserve the right to select the type of instrument most appropriate for the effort proposed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>\n\n<p>The purpose of xTechHBCU is to provide an innovative approach with multiple avenues for enduring connections with the Army S&amp;T ecosystem and to highlight opportunities for participants to collaborate with the Army to tackle critical Army challenges.  Five (5) critical technology focus areas are identified at the end of this announcement, where basic and applied research solutions are needed to enable our future Army to succeed and where follow-on research funding may be available for the eligible entities described above. For each submission, at least one of the five (5) focus areas below must be addressed and noted in the drop-down menu provided on the xTechHBCU registration page.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Problem Statements</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 1 (Computing Sciences): Knowledge Systems</em></p>\n\n<p>The overall objective of the Knowledge Systems program is to augment human decision makers (both commanders and Soldiers) with enhanced-embedded battlefield intelligence that will provide them with the necessary situational awareness, reconnaissance, and decision making tools to decisively defeat any future adversarial threats which is in line with the DoD’s adoption of net-centric warfare, variously defined as flattening the information space to interconnect Soldiers and commanders to provide instantaneous access to information, knowledge, and situational awareness. Given this goal, it becomes necessary to understand (a) fundamentals of what intelligence means in the context of autonomous systems and how to build intelligent systems especially as it relates to interaction amongst a network of humans and machines, and (b) foundational algorithmic issues in representation and reasoning about networks inherent in societies and nature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Information Networks.</strong> In order to model network effects, it is necessary to algorithmically represent large networks and reason about them. Unfortunately, information about networks is seldom complete – data available might be missing crucial pieces of information, might have contradictory pieces of information, or could be approximate (with associated notions of uncertainty). Representing and reasoning about these networks requires advances in knowledge representation, graph and data mining, natural language processing, algorithmic graph theory, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification and reasoning. Examples include the emerging area of Graphons which provide new tools for generating and reasoning about graphs that occur in practice (satisfying power law distributions), but also provide new tools for Machine Learning. In particular, a major goal of this thrust are tools and techniques that allow data driven approaches to capturing latent relationships with powers to both explain and predict. Advances in this thrust would not only lead to improved autonomous systems and algorithms, but also enhanced-embedded battlefield intelligence with tools for creating necessary situational awareness, reconnaissance, and decision making. Finally, it should be noted that algorithmic notions of approximations, tight performance bounds, probabilistic guarantees, etc., would be major concerns of the solution space.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Adversarial Reasoning.</strong> Development of appropriate mathematical tools to model and reason about societies and cultures, that brings together tools from Game Theory, Social Sciences and Knowledge Representation. Research of interest includes, but is not limited to, Game Theory for security applications while accounting for bounded rationality, development of Game Theory based on data regarding cultural and adversarial groups, and Behavioral Game Theory that can explain intelligence in groups and societies. In particular, the role of human biases in decision making and game theory is of importance to this thrust of the program.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural Language Processing and Affective Computing.</strong> Inference algorithms work incredibly well when data is in a structured format. However, most reports, email, and conversations are written out as text with information embedded in them. This thrust seeks advances in purposeful Natural Language Processing at scale that can account for context and mode-switches by bringing together statistical and logical methods. Indeed, when combined with other signals, such as video signals, the inter-play of non-verbal and verbal/ textual communication provides rich contextual information, which, in turn, leads to accurate information being gleaned from an interaction.</p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 2 (Computing Sciences): Advanced Learning Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems</em></p>\n\n<p>Advanced Learning Intelligent Cyber Physical Systems, including both embodied systems and software agents, play an increasingly important role in civilian and military settings. With few exceptions, current intelligent systems are restricted to highly constrained environments for short duration missions. Future systems will need to perform a variety of tasks in complex, possibly contested, open worlds for extended periods of time. One important characteristic of open worlds is that the intelligent system will encounter new contexts, activities, and objects that will require it to adapt previously trained algorithms. Advanced capabilities in learning, knowledge representation and reasoning, interaction, and assured operations are essential to the development of intelligent systems that can greatly enhance the Army’s mobility, agility, lethality, and survivability in future conflicts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Learning Theory, Methodology, and Techniques.</strong> Over the past 50 years, machine learning has made great strides in classification, natural language processing, and task learning. However, machine learning still lacks the rigor, agility, and flexibility necessary to operate in complex, contested open worlds. This thrust focuses on establishing a theoretical foundation for on-line or continuous machine learning. New learning approaches will need to address both the dimensionality challenges and temporal characteristics that may be evolving continuously. In addition, new techniques must address robustness to enable the learning system to deal with novelty, noise, observation errors, and potentially malicious input that aims to disrupt learning. Innovative approaches to continuous learning will allow systems to adapt to changing contexts and environments while maintaining previously learned knowledge. Under this thrust, we investigate approaches that help the intelligent systems deal with dynamic environments, devise new, transferable skills, and cope with unknown situations. Skill acquisition focuses on developing new theories for learning, creating, and combining low-level skills into more sophisticated behaviors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Knowledge Representation, Reasoning and Decision Making.</strong> Long duration autonomy requires intelligent systems to manage information from different sources, including humans, knowledge bases, and external and on-board sensors. Data collected at different times and locations needs to be fused into a consistent understanding of objects and events in the environment, to support decision making and efficient communication with humans or other entities. Long duration autonomy requires reflecting on past experiences, combining, comparing, and using those experiences in new contexts to make decisions. Innovative research in representation and reasoning will enable future intelligent systems to manage information in both short and long-term memory systems, and develop new information through reflection and learning. Concepts from cognitive science may impact both the representation and storage of information and the ability to quickly retrieve pertinent information. New approaches are needed to combine reasoning with deep learning enabling systems to discover and use relationships between objects and concepts in learning, inference and reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Interaction.</strong> Future autonomous systems must interact physically with humans and other intelligent systems operating in the same space, remotely with spatially distant entities, and virtually in cyberspace with intelligent software agents. New research in human-robot interaction and robot-robot teaming will enable humans and robots to share the same space and work together on complex tasks. Advanced concepts for networks of intelligent agents will enable robots at the tactical edge to draw upon off-board resources such as, software agents, humans, or other robots to solve local problems as well as contribute to a shared knowledge base, and coordinate and collaborate with others for larger problems in dynamic environments. New research in game theory, deception, and other approaches will enable intelligent systems to operate effectively in a contested environment. Future battlefields pose a number of challenges in communications including, limited bandwidth and the availability of secure communication channels. New concepts are needed to build and maintain shared, but possibly distributed, information models for these environments.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Assured Operations.</strong> Test, Evaluation, and Verification and Validation for intelligent systems is a nascent field that needs rigorous theoretical underpinnings and practical tools. Long duration missions require intelligent systems that can operate safely and reliably in an open world environment. Extending techniques from computer science and control theory, such as control barrier functions and model checking, can help ensure safe operations during both learning and execution of mission-related activities, but these techniques by themselves are not sufficient for assured operations. Theoretical advances in architectures, control theory, and introspection are needed to enable systems to adapt to temporary or permanent changes to internal and external conditions in a timely manner. Advances in risk-aware online planning will enable autonomous systems to balance conflicting objectives and operate safely in poorly understood environments.</p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 3 (Life Sciences): Neurophysiology of Cognition</em></p>\n\n<p>The Neurophysiology of Cognition program supports non-medically oriented basic research in neuroscience, the behavioral sciences, physiology and neuroengineering that might enable the optimization of Soldier’s cognitive and physical performance capabilities. An overarching goal of the program is to provide foundational knowledge of molecular, cellular and systems-level neural codes underlying cognition and performance across multiple length and time scales. Research in this program can include a broad range of methodological and theoretical approaches applied to animal and human experimental systems including electrophysiology, neuroimaging and computational neurobiology. This includes the study of the psycho-physiological implications of brain-machine interfaces, the measurement and modeling of individual cognitive dynamics and decision making during real-world activity, and identifying how neuronal circuits generate desirable computations. In the long term, research in this area may enable the development of interfaces enabling humans to more efficiently control machines, new training methods and devices to predict and optimize individual performance, and the potential restoration from injury at the neural level. Basic research opportunities are sought in two primary research thrusts within this program: (i) Multisensory Synthesis and (ii) Neuronal Computation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Multisensory Synthesis.</strong> The Multisensory Synthesis thrust aims to understand how the human brain functions in relation to the interaction of sensory, cognitive and motor processes during its performance of real-world tasks. Research focuses on mapping, quantifying and modeling distributed neural processes, physiological processes and mind-body interfaces that mediate these features to ultimately develop better understanding of cognition for eventual application to Soldier performance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Neuronal Computation.</strong> The Neuronal Computation thrust is focused on understanding how living neuronal circuits generate desirable computations, affect how information is represented, show robustness to damage, incorporate learning and facilitate evolutionary change. Research focuses on determining how brains structure, process and refine inputs into efficient decisions and behaviors, and how these multiscale features are altered under stresses. Cell culture, brain slice and in vivo models are used to develop better understanding of small and large-scale living neural networks for eventual application in Army systems.</p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 4 (Life Sciences): Human Dimension</em></p>\n\n<p>The Human Dimension Program supports multidisciplinary basic research in areas that include neural and cognitive sciences, behavioral and social sciences and human factors and neural engineering with an emphasis on modeling, predicting and enhancing human perceptual, cognitive, affective, physical, and social performance in individuals, groups and societies. An overarching goal of the program is to provide foundational knowledge of neural, biophysiological and cognitive-based mechanisms underlying individual, group and societal cognition and performance across multiple time scales. In the long term, research in this area may enable new training tools to predict and optimize cognitive/physical performance and team intelligence, interfaces enabling humans to more efficiently control machines and psychophysiologically-based predictive models of complex individual – societal dynamics. Basic research opportunities are sought in two primary research thrusts within this program: (i) Cognitive-Physical Interactions and (ii) Cognitive-Social Interactions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cognitive-Physical Interactions.</strong> The Cognitive-Physical Interactions thrust seeks to support high-risk seed projects that use multimodal approaches to uncover dynamic and multiscale interactions of neural-cognitive and physiological systems. The goal of this thrust area is to advance the experimental and analytical tools available to develop comprehensive understanding of the impact of group and individual state-trait variability on human performance, human-systems interfaces and team intelligence. Research topics are supported in diverse areas that can include the neurobiological mechanisms of expert skill learning, closed-loop brain-computer interfaces and novel mind-body interfaces such as the microbiome-gut-brain axis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cognitive-Social Interactions.</strong> The Cognitive-Social Interactions thrust seeks to develop new theories to understand the dynamic interrelationships between individual/group cognition, decision-making and the role that these influences play on interactions with large and small social systems. Multidisciplinary seed projects are supported that seek to advance the necessary analytical and experimental tools required to describe the underlying mechanistic interactions as they co-evolve in time and space. Research topics are supported in diverse areas that may include modeling the impact of mindfulness on state transitions of human cognitive, physical and social systems and describing the longitudinal neural, cognitive and social mechanisms mediating development of leadership, expertise and intelligent teams.</p>\n\n<p><em>Topic 5 (Physics): Interface science of emerging electronic materials</em></p>\n\n<p>A host of advanced electronic materials have emerged in the last twenty years and promise many novel technological advances in electronics. These advances, however, are often hamstrung by insufficient knowledge about interface science ranging from suitable contacting, gating, dielectrics and charge trapping to heterogeneous integration with established semiconductors. This topic seeks to address this knowledge gap specific to two emergent electronic materials families: topological materials and two-dimensional van de Waals materials. What are the fabrication, integration and processing methodologies necessary for effectual gating and contacting of these materials and for integrating them with semiconductors? Furthermore, how are the electronic properties of the material changed when integrated into a heterostructure? The Army is seeking to establish a theoretical and/or experimental research endeavor to begin to address these challenges.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>10 August 2021</strong> - Application Part 1: Research Concept Submission period open</li>\n  <li><strong>1 October 2021</strong> - Application Part 1: Research Concept Submission period closed</li>\n  <li><strong>15 October 2021</strong> - Part 1: Research Concept Submission winners notified</li>\n  <li><strong>15 November 2021</strong> - Part 2: Draft Proposal Submitted</li>\n  <li><strong>6 December 2021</strong> - Part 2 Winners notified</li>\n  <li><strong>NLT 14 January 2022</strong> - Final Proposal Submitted</li>\n  <li><strong>NLT 21 January 2022</strong> - Part 3: Finals – Participants conduct a final pitch to a panel of Army experts</li>\n  <li><strong>21 January 2022</strong> - Winners Announced</li>\n  <li><strong>TBD January 2022</strong> - HBCU Faculty Showcase Event</li>\n</ul>\n",

Concept submissions will be evaluated by a team of Army experts including scientific, technical, acquisition, and user experts.  Submissions will consist of a brief concept description that includes a 1-page concept white paper and an optional video no more than 3 minutes in length to further describe or demonstrate the concept.  Participants are not required to submit a professional video, videos can be taken on a cell phone or another device of your choice and will not be graded on production quality, but rather will provide an additional format to further explain your proposed research concept.</p>\n\n<p>All submissions shall adhere to the following requirements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>All concept white papers must be submitted using the template found on the Valid Eval registration page, “xTechHBCU_WhitePaper_Template.doc”.  <strong>Any proposals submitted in a format other than that provided by the template will not be reviewed, please read all instructions on the first page of the template document carefully.</strong></li>\n  <li>Optionally, participants may submit an accompanying Video to further describe the concept to the Army evaluators.  All videos shall be submitted <strong>using a Vimeo link</strong> with no password protection to ensure that all evaluators will have access. Concept Videos do not require professionals to develop, the videos can be taken from a phone, camera or any equipment that is already readily available to faculty members.</li>\n  <li>Please list your name(s) and proposal title <strong>EXACTLY</strong> how you would like them to appear on any contest marketing materials. Use clear and concise proposal titles to give readers and potential stakeholders an understanding of how your research or technology concept would benefit the Army.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Research Concepts applications will be evaluated and ranked using the following Scoring Criteria (further details on each scoring dimension can be found on the xTechHBCU registration page):</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Introduction – 5%</li>\n  <li>Alignment and Degree of Innovation – 30%</li>\n  <li>Technology and Concept Viability – 30%</li>\n  <li>Team – 25%</li>\n  <li>Narrative Quality – 10%</li>\n  <li>Potential for Army Impact – 0% (this is graded as a means to provide Army feedback only, but will not impact proposal evaluation scores at this stage)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upon competition of Part 1, the top-rated research concepts, up to a maximum of 54, will receive a prize of $5,000, and be invited to submit a more detailed draft proposal in Part 2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 2: Draft Proposal</strong></p>\n\n<p>All selected participants from Part 1 will be invited to submit a 3-page draft proposal and an optional video no more than 5 minutes in length to further describe or demonstrate the concept. The xTechHBCU program will provide optional virtual programming to all applicants during this part of the competition to help align their research proposals with Army problems and provide insight and guidance to faculty members as they develop a draft proposal for award. Detailed instructions and evaluation criteria for draft proposals will be provided to Part 2 participants.</p>\n\n<p>Although evaluation criteria and associated weights may vary across xTechHBCU phases, the evaluation criteria across all phases is derived from the originating ARO Open Broad Agency Announcement (<a href=\"https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AROBAA_W911NF17S0002-Amendment-9.pdf\">BAA</a>) and, in general and not limited to, will touch on the following factors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><em>Scientific or technical merit</em> – the overall scientific and technical merit, creativity, and innovation of the concept submission.</li>\n  <li><em>Potential for Army Impact</em> – the potential impact on the US military (e.g., specific application areas and/or specific platforms or users of relevance).</li>\n  <li><em>Team qualifications</em> – qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed PI, team leader, or other key personnel who are critical to achievement of the proposed objectives; and the applicants record of past performance.</li>\n  <li><em>Proposal Quality</em> – quality of the narrative, arguments, and data attribution to support arguments with relevant, properly attributed data.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Upon conclusion of the judging for Part 2, the Army will select up to twelve (12) winners to receive a prize of $15,000 and an invitation to the Finals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part 3: Final Proposal</strong></p>\n\n<p>Selected participants from Part 2 will be invited to conduct an in-person or virtual 15-minute presentation followed by a 15-minute Q&amp;A session with a panel of Army experts.  Selected participants from Part 2 will also have an opportunity to participate in more intensive optional virtual and/or in-person programming to engage directly with Program Managers (PMs) and SMEs associated with topics outlined in this announcement, work directly with key Army stakeholders, further align their research proposals with Army problems, and gain additional insight and guidance on how to develop a final proposal for award consideration. As with Part 2 above, detailed instructions, evaluation criteria for final proposals will be provided to Part 3 participants and will follow from the ARO <a href=\"https://www.arl.army.mil/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AROBAA_W911NF17S0002-Amendment-9.pdf\">BAA</a>.

            "description": "<p>This NIWC Atlantic Tech Bridge Prize Challenge is seeking submissions for two topics: Multilevel Security, Assured Position Navigation and Timing (PNT). This prize challenge is being run under 10 USC § 2374a and is considered an independent effort.  However, the results of this prize challenge may result in an additional follow-on acquisition opportunity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic 1: Multilevel Security</strong></p>\n\n<p>Multilevel Security (MLS) allows the sharing of sensitive information across security boundaries and multiple communities of interest. Having information of different security levels on the same computer systems poses a real threat.  It is not a straight-forward matter to isolate different information security levels, even though different users log in using different accounts, with different permissions and different access controls. Ideal solutions for MLS applications would simultaneously permits access by users with different security clearances and access levels while denying access for users who lack authorization.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Topic 2: Assured Position Navigation and Timing (PNT)</strong></p>\n\n<p>A strategy to provide Assured Position Navigation and Timing (PNT) inputs in environments where input may not be available or not as reliable from the Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) constellation. Any viable alternative must operate under conditions where radio frequency PNT signals are temporarily or permanently denied, degraded, or unreliable. Ability to overcome additional constraints of the operating environment (such as environments indoors, underground, or where radio frequency signals cannot be received) is also of value. Ideal solutions should be able to support diverse use cases in support of small, mobile systems, including dismounted Marines using an alternative PNT data input to locate and track oneself, and others (by feeding such input into a network). Use cases include, but are not limited to, individuals/units navigating within a building or across large geographic areas, and using alternative PNT data input to locate and track individuals, small unmanned surface, subsurface, or air vehicles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Challenge will go through a two-stage judging process.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Stage 1: Initial Submissions.</em></strong> Submissions will be judged by panel members with resident knowledge of the subject.  Judging panel members will evaluate each submission based on the criteria outlined in the judging criteria below.  Each topic will be evaluated separately and independently from one another.  The goal of Stage 1 for the evaluators is to select five (5) participants and one (1) alternate for each topic, to present oral presentations at the CDCA Defense Summit on Dec. 7-9, 2021.  In the event that one of the first five (5) participants selected for oral presentations cannot attend the CDCA Summit, the alternate’s representative will be contacted for interest in presenting an oral presentation.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Stage 2: Oral Presentations at the CDCA Summit.</em></strong> The top five (5) participants for each technology category will be invited to present, at their own cost, the technology topic associated with their initial submission.  Participants selected to give oral presentations will give two (2) presentations at the CDCA Summit on December 7-9, 2021.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong><em>Presentation 1: Pitch Jam On Stage at CDCA Summit</em></strong> – Selected participants will give a live presentation, on-stage in the exhibit hall at the CDCA Defense Summit. The audience will be made up of both CDCA Conference attendees and Government representatives. This presentation should be high-level and is not to exceed 10 minutes. There will not be a question and answer period for this presentation. At the conclusion of this presentation, conference attendees will vote on a People’s Choice Best in Show winner for each topic. Each topic winner will be presented with a Best in Show award on the third day of the CDCA Summit, 9 December 2021.</li>\n  <li><strong><em>Presentation 2: Private Orals with the Government</em></strong> - The second presentation will be conducted privately with the Government evaluators and other government representatives interested in the exchange. Only the participants and Government representatives will be present for this presentation. The oral presentation should be limited to a not to exceed 30 minute period followed by approximately 20 minutes of questions and answers. Only the government evaluators will ask questions. At the conclusion of all oral presentations, the Government judging panel team will privately discuss the oral presentations to determine the Prize Challenge winner and a runner up. The Prize Challenge Winner for each topic will be announced on the third day of the CDCA Summit, 9 December 2021.  Each topic winner will be presented with a Prize of $7,500, and the runner up will receive an Honorable Mention.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Prizes will be distributed to the eligible winners via electronic funds transfer (EFT), within 90 business days of the announcement of the winner(s).  NIWC Atlantic will distribute the funds evenly to all team members. Eligibility to receive an award is based upon the participant’s adherence to all rules for this Challenge. Funding for this Challenge will come from both overhead and direct funding.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>If the Prize Challenge winners have previously done business with the US Government and have a CAGE (Commercial and Government Entity) code, the winner will be able to provide that information to the contest organizers.  The contest organizers will use it to complete the SF 1034, public voucher other than personnel.   The winner will then submit the completed voucher to vendor pay.  Vendor pay would then certify the payment.</li>\n  <li>If the winners do not already have a CAGE code, they need go to the System for Award Management (SAM) URL <a href=\"https://www.sam.gov/SAM/\">https://www.sam.gov/SAM/</a> to create an account and register their business.  Once they have the CAGE code, they would give the CAGE code to the contest organizers, who would use it to complete the SF 1034.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Stage 1: Submissions 19 August – 19 September 2021</li>\n  <li>Stage 1: Judging: 19 September – 19 October 2021</li>\n  <li>Stage 2: Invitation to Participants for Oral Presentations by 29 October 2021</li>\n  <li>Stage 2: RSVP by 05 November 2021</li>\n  <li>Stage 2: Oral Submissions electronic briefing material provided by 19 November 2021</li>\n  <li>Oral Presentations on 7 and 8 December 2021</li>\n</ul>\n",

Though the solution should foster connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology or develop new technology applications, it may be targeted at consumers (persons with dementia (PWD), caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state governments. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the product must be included with the working proof-of-concept demonstration. Please see the &ldquo;Submission Requirements and Template&rdquo; section for the necessary submission information.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Description</strong></p>\n<p>The National Institute on Aging (NIA) announces the &ldquo;Improving Care for People with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and Related Dementias Using Technology (iCare-AD/ADRD)&rdquo; Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to improve the quality of care for persons living with Alzheimer&rsquo;s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) by establishing proof-of-concept for the creation of a widely accessible and innovative technology tool(s) that addresses unmet needs in care coordination and/or care navigation through the health system. For the purpose of this challenge, &ldquo;related dementias&rdquo; will include frontotemporal dementia, Lewy Body dementia and vascular cognitive impairment/dementia.</p>\n<p>This challenge is intended to stimulate innovation in use of technology to improve care coordination and/or navigation and/or aid with the care experience, so that overall dementia care quality is improved. This challenge invites solutions that involve the development of an IT system-level, computer, mobile, and/or other form of technology-based application.&nbsp; The solutions may involve creation of a new technology application, and/or modification or novel implementation of an existing technology. &nbsp;The solutions may be targeted at consumers (persons with dementia or caregivers), healthcare providers, healthcare service organizations, and/or health systems, and/or community, local, or state government. Specific methods for stimulating uptake and use of the solutions must be included with the proof-of-concept demonstrations.</p>\n<p>A working demonstration of the product is required. Specific target markets or characteristics of end users must be identified.</p>\n<p>The Challenge is expected to foster connections between relevant stakeholders to use technology to improve dementia care coordination and/or care navigation. &nbsp;Collaboration with and connections between relevant healthcare stakeholders are encouraged. Collaboration across organizations, for example, physician practices, nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and smart technology vendors, is also encouraged. Examples of possible solvers include small businesses, individuals -- including but not limited to people living with dementia and caregivers -- midsize to large technology companies, health insurance companies, electronic health record (EHR) vendors, students working collaboratively across multiple disciplines, health systems, states, and/or counties implementing care coordination programs.</p>\n<p>Examples that would fulfill the purpose of the Challenge include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ol> <li><em>Aiding effective communication between clinicians and patients and families </em>:&nbsp; Solvers could develop a mobile application to assist persons with dementia (PWD) and caregivers at primary care and specialty physician visits. The application could be tailored to individual care needs, prepopulated with diagnoses and medications used, and include prompts for questions to ask clinicians or links to local resources and/or relevant insurance coverage information.</li> <li><em>Aiding care access and access to relevant community resources and/or enhancing user-friendliness of existing service access interfaces</em>:&nbsp; Solvers could use technology to assist PWD with aging in place, improve access to appropriate transportation options using smart devices, and coordinate health care visits.</li> <li><em>Improving care coordination</em>:&nbsp; A collaboration between a technology company, EHR vendor, and nursing home chain could yield EHR-based methods to improve care coordination. Care coordination solutions may also involve behavioral &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; for care providers and/or care recipients using smart technology and may be designed for direct use by PWD and caregivers.</li> </ol>\n<p>The full description, rules, and details of this challenge are defined on NIA&rsquo;s challenge details page (<strong><a href=\"https://nia.nih.gov/challenge-prize\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://nia.nih.gov/challenge-prize</a></strong>).</p>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>The Problem</strong></p>\n<p>The global wildlife trade is actively spreading a deadly disease that could cause hundreds, if not thousands, of the world&rsquo;s 7,000 known species of amphibians to go extinct unless we take immediate action to combat its spread. This disease is caused by two species of pathogenic chytrid fungi, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans(Bsal), which were recently introduced to amphibian populations. These fungi thrive in wet cool environments, and amphibians in at least 60 countries have already been exposed.</p>\n<p>Every year, millions of amphibians are traded globally for use as pets, food, and research, without any required disease screening prior to transport. In each shipment, the number of amphibians can range from one to many thousands and must be quickly released to the importer. Bd and Bsal are invisible to the naked eye, and infections rarely cause visible symptoms prior to death. Therefore, genetic sampling and laboratory analysis are the most common detection method. Rapid, cost-effective chytrid detection methods are urgently needed to stop infected animals and contaminated shipping materials from entering the USA to reduce the threat of disease to native biodiversity.</p>\n<p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p>\n<p>Amphibian chytrid fungi are lethal to frogs and salamanders, and we must be able to detect its presence before we can eradicate it from infected animals. This challenge seeks innovative solutions to rapidly confirm and quantify the presence of chytrid fungi (Bd and Bsal) through non-invasive techniques in material imported into the United States. This includes detection on live animals, in water samples, and on surfaces of shipping containers (cardboard boxes, plastic bags, etc.). Detection is the first step towards a longer-term goal of developing treatments to safely eradicate Bd and Bsal from large commercial shipments of live amphibians that are imported for human consumption.</p>\n<p>There are three focus areas of this challenge:</p>\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp; LIVE ANIMALS ROADBLOCK:&nbsp; LIVE ANIMALS CANNOT BE HARMED OR HELD FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME.</strong></p>\n<p>Amphibians are purchased as exotic pets, for human consumption (as frogs legs), and biomedical research subjects, and therefore, cannot be damaged in the detection process. These animals must be released to importers as quickly as possible following their arrival in order to protect their health (in a matter of a couple hours, or less, following importation). Currently, the time required to submit DNA samples to a laboratory and obtain results can be days, if not weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp; WATER SAMPLES ROADBLOCK:&nbsp; LARGE WATER SAMPLES ARE CURRENTLY NEEDED TO DETECT LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF BD/BSAL</strong></p>\n<p>Similar to the current Bd/Bsal detection methods on a live animal, a water filter sample must be collected and submitted to a laboratory for molecular analysis where the presence of pathogen DNA can be confirmed via<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction\">&nbsp;PCR</a>. Each sample can cost approximately $20-$40 to have processed, and low pathogen concentrations may dip below current genetic detection limits to accurately and confidently identify the presence of Bd/Bsal in water.

The overall cost for detecting the presence of Bd/Bsal in a shipment must be less than US$50.</li> <li><strong>POWER:</strong>&nbsp;Detection must be performed onsite without access to electricity.</li> <li><strong>ACCURACY:</strong>&nbsp;The test must exceed the Bd qPCR sensitivity and specificity of 72.9% and 94.2%, respectively, as per Skerratt et al. (2011) and be able to detect the presence of 1 or more Bd/Bsal zoospore equivalents.</li> <li><strong>NON-INVASIVE TO ANY ANIMAL:</strong>&nbsp;A tissue sample must not be required from any animal, whether live or dead, but skin swabs and water samples are allowed (one current invasive method of chytrid detection is by microscopic examination to observe the presence of infection in a tissue sample).</li> <li><strong>QUANTIFICATION:</strong>&nbsp;The test must be able to quantify the burden of infection present (pathogen load).</li> <li><strong>IDENTIFICATION:&nbsp;</strong>Results must provide the information needed to identify the lineage of pathogen present.</li> </ul>\n<p>The ability to quantify the pathogen load is also desired, though not a required capability of a successful solution.</p>\n",

EPA will award up to $50,000 in prize money to the best performing sensor prototypes! Download the Testing Application at <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal</a>, due July 26, 2019!</strong></p> <p>Conventional on-site wastewater treatment systems, or OWTS, (also referred to as septic systems) are not designed to remove nitrogen to the extent required for avoiding harmful algal blooms and for protecting and restoring many productive and valuable marine and coastal waters. Successfully removing nitrogen to address these concerns may require use of more advanced technology in OWTS. Regulatory officials recognize the benefit and value of solutions that remove high nitrogen levels but need more confidence in the long-term performance of I/A OWTS technologies before approving their use. Effective long-term management of I/A nitrogen removal OWTS requires data that provides a real- time indication of proper functioning over the lifetime of the treatment system. <strong>A sensor which can measure the nitrogen concentration in I/A OWTS effluent coupled with real time reporting would give regulators, managers, communities and homeowners improved ability to assure systems are working properly, optimize their performance, and maintain these technologies over their lifetime, as well as provide the information needed to assess the effectiveness of restoration actions on receiving waters.</strong> Cost effective verification of system performance through use of a nitrogen sensor will protect public health and the environment, provide data to confirm and revise estimates of watershed-wide nutrient loadings, allow for more accurate models of nitrogen impact on receiving waters, and offer evidence of reasonable return on investment for homeowners and communities.</p> <p>The ideal sensor would provide accurate measurement of total nitrogen in I/A OWTS effluent, include telemetry, be self-calibrating or require infrequent calibration, last 10 years, require no more than 1 maintenance visit per year and cost the homeowner less than $1,000. Such an ideal technology may not be possible. At a minimum, a sensor would provide accurate measurement of nitrate (NO-3) and ammonium (NH+4), be easily accessed and maintained (no more than four maintenance visits per year), require infrequent calibration, last 5 years and cost less than $1,500. Because Total Nitrogen is composed of organic and inorganic fractions, measuring NO-3 and NH+4 may significantly underestimate Total Nitrogen. To address this, the near-ideal sensor would measure NO-3 and NH+4, as well as Total Organic Carbon (TOC). The TOC value would be used to estimate Organic Nitrogen using an empirically-derived value of the nitrogen content of the TOC.</p> <p>Phase I of the Challenge requested submissions of sensor designs having the capabilities discussed above, and awards were given at the June 29, 2017 Sensor Showcase Day.</p> <p>Phase II, the Prototype Testing Program, is being managed by EPA. EPA selected Battelle Memorial Institute (Battelle) to support the development of a Test/Quality Assurance Plan and Verification Protocol (T/QAP) and oversee the testing of the sensor prototypes. Battelle is collaborating with <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal</a> to ensure compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.iso.org/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Organization for Standardization (ISO)</a> Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Standard - 14034. Phase II testing is being conducted at the Massachusetts Alternative Septic System Test Center (<a href=\"https://www.barnstablecountyhealth.org/programs-and-services/massachusetts-alternative-septic-system-test-center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MASSTC</a>), a National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) certified test facility in Barnstable, Massachusetts.  Funding for the testing program is from the US EPA Office of Research and Development and the Office of Water/Wastewater Management.</p> <p>Battelle has convened a Technical Panel to provide the technical input and expertise necessary to develop an effective verification protocol and T/QAP based on the ISO ETV Standard 14034.  The Technical Panel includes experts from EPA, US Geological Survey (USGS), the Alliance for Coastal Technologies, the University of Maryland, the New England Onsite Wastewater Training Program at the University of Rhode Island (URI), the MASSTC, onsite regulators from MA and Suffolk County NY, the National Onsite Wastewater Recycling Association (NOWRA – onsite wastewater manufacturers are members of this association), the New York State Center for Clean Water Technology at Stony Brook University, and other university engineering programs.</p> <h3>Phase II Prototype Testing 2019-2020</h3> <p>The first step of the preliminary screening process is a one-week test. It is scheduled to run from <strong>August 21 through August 27, 2019,</strong> with sensor set up dates of August 19 and 20. <strong>For this final round of open prototype testing, EPA will award up to $50,000 in prize money to the best performing sensor(s).</strong> This prototype testing is the last opportunity that is open to all sensor developers (not dependent on previous participation) that believe their sensor prototype can meet or exceed the performance goals of the Challenge detailed in the Test and Quality Assurance Plan (T/QAP). <strong>Sensor developers that are interested in participating in the one-week test must submit an application which can be found on <a href=\"http://www.verifiglobal.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VerifiGlobal</a> by July 26, 2019.</strong></p> <p>In addition to the cash prize, sensors which meet the Challenge performance goals will be invited to participate in the one-month screening test, which is tentatively planned for December 2019. Sensors which pass the one-month test will be invited to the six-month ISO ETV 14034 field verification test, which is tentatively scheduled for May through November 2020.

Overall, the solution should provide a novel solution to building a 3-D human retina that meets the desired scientific criteria (structure, function, morphology). Reviewers will be asked to specifically&nbsp;address:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Impact on potential end users, clinical implications, and therapeutic advances &mdash;To what extent will the solution exert a sustained, powerful influence on the understanding of retinal diseases and accelerating research toward new&nbsp;therapies?</li> <li>To what extent does the solution address a significant barrier in the development of human retina organoids that are highly representative of human physiology? Does the approach speed up organoid development and differentiation time, improve yield, or increase&nbsp;production?</li> <li>How is the solution unique and does it improve upon state of the science for organoid&nbsp;technology?</li> <li>To what extent are novel concepts, approaches, methodologies, technologies or instrumentation used, or are existing approaches applied in a novel&nbsp;way?</li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 2. Cell Types, Structure, and Function (25 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">25%</strong> </h4> Solutions will be evaluated for establishment of a human PSC-derived in vitro retina model system that resembles the morphology of a healthy-native retina and is viable through formation of photoreceptor outer segments and/or long-term survival of retinal ganglion cells with extension of axonal processes. Reviewers will be asked to address:&nbsp;Cell Types:&nbsp;How many neuronal (or neuronal derived) cell types are stably co-cultured (rod and cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells, Muller glia)? Are long-term viable and functional RPE, choroid or non-neuronal cell types (e.g., pericytes, microglia, astrocytes) incorporated? To what extent does the evidence presented show presence of cell types and 3-dimensional structure. If a cell type is lacking, is there justification for why it is not present and not needed for proof of principle (i.e. the disease being modelled lacks the specific cell type)?  Structure:&nbsp;Are organoid prototypes 3-dimensional and properly oriented? To what extent do the synaptic layers recapitulate those of a laminated retina with multiple neuron classes present in numbers and proportions that represent an in vivo setting (as indicated by biomarkers of lineage and differentiation)? How many other retina and retina-relevant tissues, cells, or structures are included?  Functional characterization of cell types:&nbsp;Are all cell types in the organoid (or added to the organoid) functional through the latest viable timepoint as shown by appropriate analyses, including electrophysiology (e.g., light response and recovery for subsequent responses, etc.), retinoid recycling, cell communication, functional connectivity, fluid transport in RPE, etc.? </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 3. Reproducibility, Quality Control, and Standardization (25 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">25%</strong> </h4> Assessment of inter/intra-laboratory utility, transferability, and reproducibility, with conclusive evidence that organoid prototype is based on a reproducible protocol and the protocol produces a relatively standardized product. Reproducibility:&nbsp;To what extent do the data support reproducibility and standardization (e.g., data showing transferability to other labs and lack of variability from batch to batch) included?  To what extent is documentation of standardization or commercialization highlighted (i.e. cGMP protocols or patent applications)? Are the methods (part of the Appendix) sufficiently detailed such that the efforts could be reproduced (e.g., Standard operating protocols)?  Robustness:&nbsp;How do the data support advances in organoid development to decrease differentiation time, improve yield, or increase production?  Have retina organoids been characterized to show they are free of microbial contamination and chromosomal defects (i.e. karyotyping, STR analysis, FISH analysis)?  Are formal documented agreements with industry, or transferability to industry partners (MOUs, licensing, CRADA, in-kind or discounted validation) presented? </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 4. Endpoint Assay Specific Goals (30 points for EITHER category) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">30%</strong> </h4> BIOLOGY/DISEASE MODELING (note:&nbsp;NEI is agnostic to which disease is chosen, as long as technology is developed to robustly recapitulate the disease):&nbsp;Does the organoid prototype demonstrate improvement in faithful biological complexity (e.g. macula, multiple cell subtypes present in physiologically similar ratios, etc.)?  Does the model recapitulate some aspect of disease phenotype in one or more assays?  Viability and scalability:&nbsp;If grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of organoids in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained? Are methods that increase the production (e.g., many dozens) of organoids and/or allow the distribution of well-characterized organoids presented to enable multiple organoids to be compared in the same experiment?  Is therapeutic intervention to treat the disease modelled with 3-D retina organoids (e.g. via gene editing, small molecules, cell replacement, etc.) demonstrated? HIGH CONTENT SCREENING:&nbsp;Are retina organoid prototypes amenable to high content screening, which may include high content imaging, drug validation/toxicology, or functional genomic screening (e.g. does not include materials known to show strong compound adsorption)? Does the model recapitulate known retina toxicities based on morphological and functional readouts? Scalability and portability:&nbsp;Are organoids grown at medium throughput (e.g., in a 96-well plate) robust? When grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of wells in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained? Are methods to mass-produce (e.g., 100s) organoids such that multiple plates can be compared in the same experiment included? </div> </div>\n",

Then join this exciting data privacy competition with <strong>up to $150,000 in prizes</strong>, where participants will create new or improved differentially private synthetic data generation tools.&nbsp; When a data set has important public value but contains sensitive personal information and can&rsquo;t be directly shared with the public, privacy-preserving synthetic data tools solve the problem by producing new, artificial data that can serve as a practical replacement for the original sensitive data, with respect to common analytics tasks such as clustering, classification and regression.&nbsp; By mathematically proving that a synthetic data generator satisfies the rigorous Differential Privacy guarantee, we can be confident that the synthetic data it produces won&rsquo;t contain any information that can be traced back to specific individuals in the original data.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge&rdquo; will entail a sequence of three marathon matches run on the Topcoder platform, asking contestants to design and implement their own synthetic data generation algorithms, mathematically prove their algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and then enter it to compete against others&rsquo; algorithms on empirical accuracy over real data, with the prospect of advancing research in the field of Differential Privacy.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;re not a differential privacy expert, and you&rsquo;d like to learn, join the Topcoder community for tutorials to help you catch up and compete!&nbsp; <strong>Join, learn, and compete for $150,000 in prizes!</strong></p>\n<h4>How Important Is This?</h4>\n<p>This challenge is focused on proactively protecting individual privacy while allowing for public safety data to be used by researchers for positive purposes and outcomes.&nbsp; NIST&rsquo;s PSCR (public safety communications research) has strong commitments to both public safety research and the preservation of security and privacy, including the use of de-identification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There is no absolute protection that data will not be misused.&nbsp; Even a dataset that protects individual identities may, if it gets into the wrong hands, be used for ill purposes.&nbsp; Weaknesses in the security of the original data can threaten the privacy of individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is well known that privacy in data release is an important area for the Federal Government (which has an Open Data Policy), state governments, the public safety sector and many commercial non-governmental organizations.&nbsp; Developments coming out of this competition would hopefully drive major advances in the practical applications of differential privacy for these organizations.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this series of competitions is to provide a platform for researchers to develop more advanced differentially private methods that can substantially improve the privacy protection and utility of the resulting datasets.</p>\n<h4>Get Involved - How to Participate</h4>\n<p><em>&gt;Note:&nbsp; All submissions for this challenge are being collected through the <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder website</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge is phase 2 of <a href=\"https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge/overview\">The Unlinkable Data Challenge:&nbsp; Advancing Methods in Differential Privacy</a>, where competitors wrote concept papers to identify new approaches to de-identification and inform the final coding design of this challenge.&nbsp; Participants of this challenge will create an algorithm and participate in a sequence of Marathon Matches. Throughout each marathon match, participants will design and implement their own differentially private synthetic data generation algorithm, mathematically prove that their algorithm satisfies differential privacy, and enter it to compete against others&rsquo; algorithms on empirical accuracy over real data, with the prospect of advancing the understanding in the field of Differential Privacy.</p>\n<p>This is a multi-phased contest with three marathon matches. Competitors may enter the contest at any point to participate between November 2018 and April 2019. Topcoder will bring the registrations from previous matches to the next matches.</p>\n<p>The marathon mechanism will provide participants with immediate feedback about the quality of their submission using an online leaderboard, which allows teams to repeatedly improve and validate the capabilities of their algorithms through several phases of increasing difficulty. In each marathon, participants are able to make changes to their algorithm, team with other Topcoder members and watch their opponents move up and down the leaderboard. The final stage in each marathon match will be a sequestered stage where participants submit their final code to be rigorously tested and evaluated.&nbsp; Where a competitor's algorithm falls with respect to the utility-privacy frontier curve will determine who wins at each marathon match.</p>\n<h4>Prize Schedule</h4>\n<p>The Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge consists of a sequence of three Marathon Matches with increasing difficulty. Each marathon match is approximately two months in length.&nbsp; For all prize eligibility, the submissions must be certified (see Match contest rule \\#8) in advance and the participants will have 24 hours to supply their code base to re-confirm their certifications.</p>\n<h4>Summary of Important Dates</h4>\n<p>Pre-registration Begins:&nbsp; October 5, 2018</p>\n<p>Challenge Launch:&nbsp; October 31, 2018 @ 9 a.m. ET</p>\n<p>Match \\#1:&nbsp; competitors submit October 31 - November 29, 2018</p>\n<p>Match \\#2:&nbsp; competitors submit January 11 - February 9, 2019</p>\n<p>Match \\#3:&nbsp; competitors submit March 10 - April 23, 2019</p>\n<p>Final Scoring Deadline:&nbsp; April 2019 (Refer to Challenge Timeline on <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/Differential-Privacy-Synthetic-Data-Challenge\">Topcoder website</a>&nbsp;under each Match page)</p>\n<p>Final Winners Announced:&nbsp; May 20, 2019 (Interim Match Winnners posted under the \"Winners\" tab)</p>\n<h4>How Do I Win?</h4>\n<p>To be eligible for an award, your submission must, at minimum:</p>\n<ul> <li>Meet the eligibility requirements in the NIST PSCR Official Challenge Rules posted on Challenge.gov under the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo; tab.</li> <li>Satisfy compliance review based on completion of the Certification Process (Match contest rule \\#8) at each match, and if you are a top scorer, submit a report for Final Review (Match contest rule \\#9).</li> <li>Score higher than your competitors!</li> </ul>\n<h4>Prizes</h4>\n<p>A total prize purse of up to $150,000 is available for this Challenge. Here is a breakdown:</p>\n<h4><strong>Final Prizes</strong></h4>\n<p>For the final prize of each match the top participants&nbsp;(1st through 5th place) will be invited via email to the final round of testing, the sequestered phase, by providing their solution in the form of a Dockerfile within 7 days of the end of the submission phase. This Dockerfile will contain their solution (source code) which will be run against the sequestered set of data and ground truth.&nbsp; A set of analytics will be run against the generated privatized data, and the same analytics will be run against the raw dataset.&nbsp; &nbsp;The results of the analytics (clustering, categorization, and linear regression) of the two sets of data will be compared using appropriate similarity scores, and a total accuracy score will be computed that represents the final score for that participant.&nbsp; The top leaders will be required to provide written documents defining their solution and providing a clear, correct proof that their solution satisfies differential privacy (see Match contest rule \\#9, Final Review).&nbsp;</p>\n<h4><strong>Progressive Prizes</strong></h4>\n<p>There are multiple ways for Challenge leaders to win progressive prizes halfway through each match and prior to the final round. Progressive prizes are announced when the Challenge is publicly launched and awarded based on the participants placement on the provisional leaderboard at an exact time (approximately half way through the challenge), and their provisional testing score (not the sequestered results).&nbsp; These prizes are awarded to the Top 4 pre-certified participants from the provisional leaderboard once their code has been inspected.&nbsp; There are 4 progressive prizes available for each marathon match at $1000 each.</p>\n<h4><strong>Additional Prizes</strong></h4>\n<p>An additional prize of $4000 may be awarded to each of the top 5 award winning teams at the end of the final marathon match who agree to provide and do provide their full code solution in an open source repository for use by all interested parties.</p>\n<h4><strong>Prize Summary</strong></h4>\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; height:246px;\" border=\"1\"> <tbody> <tr style=\"height:18px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"><strong>Match 1</strong></td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"><strong>Match 2</strong></td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"><strong>Match 3</strong></td> </tr> <tr style=\"height:174px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:174px;\"> <p>1st Plac&nbsp;$10,000</p> <p>2nd Plac&nbsp;$7,000</p> <p>3rd Plac&nbsp;$5,000</p> <p>4th Plac&nbsp;$2,000</p> <p>5th Plac&nbsp;$1,000</p> </td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:174px;\"> <p>1st Plac&nbsp;$15,000</p> <p>2nd Plac&nbsp;$10,000</p> <p>3rd Plac&nbsp;$5,000</p> <p>4th Plac&nbsp;$3,000</p> <p>5th Plac&nbsp;$2,000</p> </td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:174px;\"> <p>1st Plac&nbsp;$25,000</p> <p>2nd Plac&nbsp;$15,000</p> <p>3rd Plac&nbsp;$10,000</p> <p>4th Plac&nbsp;$5,000</p> <p>5th Plac&nbsp;$3,000</p> </td> </tr> <tr style=\"height:18px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\"> <p>Progressive Priz&nbsp;4 x $1,000</p> </td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Progressive Priz&nbsp;4 x $1,000</td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Progressive Priz&nbsp;4 x $1,000</td> </tr> <tr style=\"height:18px;\"> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Total:&nbsp;$29,000</td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Total:&nbsp;$39,000</td> <td style=\"width:33.3333%; height:18px;\">Total:&nbsp;$62,000</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<p><em>*&nbsp;An additional prize of $4000 may be awarded to each of the top 5 award winning teams at the end of the final marathon match who agree to provide and do provide their full code solution in an open source repository for use by all interested parties.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>Total Prize Purse for Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challeng&nbsp;$150,000.</strong></em></p>\n<h4>Questions?</h4>\n<p>For questions about the Official Rules or Challenge, contact <a href=\"mailto:PSprizes@nist.gov\">PSprizes@nist.gov</a> with &ldquo;Differential Privacy Synthetic Data Challenge&rdquo; in the subject.</p>\n",

This Challenge will tentatively run from October 31 2018 to May 6 2019 and be divided into a sequence of three matches.&nbsp; Each match will introduce new constraints to the scoring function, described later.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Upon registration for the challenge, the participants will receive one (1) or more datasets bifurcated into training and testing data in addition to instructions or pseudo code to generate the ground truth for the training set for all matches to date.</p>\n<p>3. For match 1 the ground truth will be generated using only Clustering Analysis.</p>\n<p>4. For match 2 the ground truth will be generated using Clustering and Classification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. For match 3 the ground truth will be generated using Clustering, Classification and Regression Analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>6. Inside the JSON submission payload, participants will receive a value of delta from NIST/Topcoder and will submit their synthetic datasets at three different values of epsilon:&nbsp; 0.1, 1, 10.&nbsp; A test harness (shell script and or Jar file) will be provided to sequentially run the participant solutions with different epsilon values that will concatenate and format the output for submission to Topcoder.&nbsp; Participants with algorithms that produce high quality privatized synthetic data on smaller values of epsilon, will receive higher scores.</p>\n<p>7. Upon proper submission, participants will be redirected to the leaderboard where they will see their handle and the new score.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8. Certification Process:&nbsp; All participants will be required to submit a complete written explanation of their algorithm, and a clear, correct mathematical proof that their solution satisfies differential privacy, to a dedicated mailbox.&nbsp; This document will be reviewed by NIST staff or their delegates (who may request clarification or rewriting if documents are unclear or underspecified).&nbsp; Participants will receive &ldquo;certification&rdquo; that they have a basic understanding of differential privacy, or a brief explanation why their algorithm or proof are incorrect.&nbsp; An indicator will display on the leaderboard to all participants who have had their approach certified.</p>\n<p>- For participants with higher than normal scores for their specified epsilon and delta, the participant algorithm and code must be provided as often as requested by NIST staff or their delegates who will review for non-intentional mistakes. This is a courtesy to ensure the participant still qualifies for prize eligibility.</p>\n<p>- Certification status will be used in determining the provisional score for entries.</p>\n<p>- Only certified approaches are eligible for cash prizes (see rule \\#9, Final Review).</p>\n<p>9. Final Review:&nbsp; Before awarding cash prizes to participants who place in prize-winning ranks at the end of each Marathon Match, these participants must submit a report containing their complete algorithm description and mathematical privacy proof, along with their source code.&nbsp; They will have 7 days notification to provide this report.&nbsp; This report will be subject to a final review to verify that their algorithm correctly satisfies differential privacy at the stated values of delta and epsilon, and that the code correctly implements the stated algorithm.&nbsp; The review will be performed by Topcoder and NIST staff or their delegates, which may include NIST certified subject matter experts from outside NIST.&nbsp; If a participant is placed in a prize winning rank but fails to provide the report, or the review determines that their solution does not satisfy differential privacy, then they will not receive a prize, and it will be awarded to the participant with the next best performance who successfully completes the final review.</p>\n<p>10. An indicator will be present on the leaderboard to identify submissions with intention to publicly share their solutions at the end of the final match.&nbsp;Having this indicator will not increase or decrease participants&rsquo; chances of winning a prize.</p>\n<p>11. Relinquish - Topcoder/NIST is allowing registered participants or teams to &ldquo;relinquish&rdquo;.&nbsp; Government employees, students or any persons who are not allowed to take monetary prizes or feel they may have a conflict of interest are welcome to participate in the challenge while agreeing to forego the monetary prizes (by responding to the Relinquish post in the challenge forum).&nbsp; Relinquish means the member will compete, and their solutions scored, but they will not be eligible for a prize. Once a person or team relinquishes, we post their name to a forum thread labeled &ldquo;Relinquished Competitors&rdquo;.&nbsp;Members who relinquish must submit their implementation code and methods to maintain leaderboard status. Winners who are identified as relinquished will still be publicly recognized in the final winner announcements based on their placement on the leaderboard and the prize award, normally allotted to the placement of the relinquished team, will be given to the next certified team on the leaderboard. Throughout the challenge, the challenge&rsquo;s online leaderboard will display rankings and accomplishments, giving them various opportunities to have their work viewed and appreciated by stakeholders from industry, government and academic communities.</p>\n<p>12. All participants must register on the challenge platform, hosted by Topcoder as members.&nbsp; If they are already members, they must be in good standing (not banned or suspended).</p>\n<p>13. Teaming is allowed, participants are permitted to form teams for this competition. After forming a team, participants of the same team are permitted to collaborate with each other. To form a team, a Topcoder member may recruit other Topcoder members, and register the team by completing the Topcoder Teaming Form for this challenge. Each team must declare a Captain. All participants in a team must individually register for this Competition and accept Topcoder's Terms and Conditions prior to joining the team. Team Captains must apportion prize distribution percentages for each teammate on the Teaming Form. The sum of all prize portions must equal 100%. The minimum permitted size of a team is 1 member, the maximum permitted team size is 5 members. Only team Captains may submit a solution to the Competition. Topcoder members participating in a team will not receive a rating for this Competition. Notwithstanding Topcoder rules and conditions to the contrary, solutions submitted by any Topcoder member who is a member of a team but is not the Captain of the team may be deleted and is ineligible for award. The deadline for forming teams is 11:59pm ET on the 21st day following the date that Registration and Submission opens as shown on the Challenge Details page for each match.

Congratulations to them all!***&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The Consumer Health Data Aggregator Challenge is intended to spur the development of third-party, consumer-facing applications that use open, standardized APIs to help consumers aggregate their data in one place and under their control. This challenge will focus on solving the problem that many consumers have today &ndash; the ability to easily and electronically access their health data from different health care providers using a variety of different health IT systems.</p>\n<p>The lack of interoperability between electronic health record (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to the modernization of health IT.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>&nbsp;(FHIR), developed by HL7, is a standard designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data. The FHIR API allows data to move between vendor systems at different providers and to third-party applications for direct use by consumers. The latter use case is key to enabling patients to play a more active role in managing their health. Patients&rsquo; ability to seamlessly take their data with them as they move from provider to provider is one of the main goals of moving from a paper-based to an electronic health record system.</p>\n<p>Of course, health and wellness information is not contained solely in provider systems - between wearables, sensors, smartphones, and more, a great deal of patient data is being collected by personal and at-home devices outside of clinical settings. An app that&nbsp;truly captures all of a consumer's health data must be able to absorb and consolidate all of this data being continuously collected, much of which is available through APIs.</p>\n<p><strong>***Watch the recording of the March 31&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB\">Informational Webinar</a>***&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who won Phase 1 &ndash; all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in Phase 1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2.&nbsp;The final application must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul> <li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard for Technical Use 2 (DSTU2)</li> <li>Aggregates all data as specified in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf\">Data column</a>)</li> <li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings. <ul> <li>There are two options to assess MU attestation here, by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Professionals.php\">Healthcare Professionals</a>&nbsp;or by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Hospitals.php\">Hospitals</a>. The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor &ndash; not Secondary EHR Vendor &ndash; in either of these reports.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Has been tested with patients and used in production settings</li> <li>Available to consumers through at least one of the following modes:&nbsp; mobile web, iOS Store, or Android Stores</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Participation Requirements&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The second phase, to run from&nbsp;June 2 to November 7, will entail the actual development of the apps, verification of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and public release of the apps. This will include remote testing with providers and health IT developers to test the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production systems. Participants will submit:</p>\n<ul> <li>Working app <ul> <li>Provide the url to download/access the app.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Video demonstrating the app (maximum of 5 minutes) <ul> <li>Provide the url of the video on YouTube or Vimeo.</li> <li>The video must highlight the use of FHIR to integrate with EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data exchange with each system. The rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation criteria:&nbsp; functionality and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of patient data, and user experience and visual appeal.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Slide deck describing app (maximum of 15 slides) <ul> <li>Overall, the slide deck should complement the video demonstration. It should include a list of the active FHIR integrations with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated in the video. It should describe other functionality pertaining to the review criteria, particularly anything that was not covered in the video.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n<p>The grand prize winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000. There will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest number of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings (the \"Ultimate Connector\"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize or 2nd place winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Participants interested in competing for Phase 1 awards will need to submit an app development plan that must include:</p>\n<ul> <li>Mockup/wireframes of the app <ul> <li>Provide a clear sense of the look, feel, and interactions of the app.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Technical specifications, including but not limited to planned data sources, system architecture, and compliance with HIPAA regulations (and other applicable law) <ul> <li>Provide a realistic idea of what data sources, and from who, will be included; how that data will be integrated together and in service to the consumer&rsquo;s needs; how data privacy and security will be implemented.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Business/sustainability plan <ul> <li>How does the submitter propose to enter the market and lead to a successful app? The plan should include the following:&nbsp; <ol> <li>Issue analysis, demonstrating understanding of the issue (1 page)</li> <li>Solution description, describing the solution and how it addresses the issues (2 pages)</li> <li>Financial estimates, including revenues and expenses (2 pages)</li> <li>Engagement plan, including targeted customer base and stakeholders (2 pages)</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Provider partnership <ul> <li>Submitters are strongly encouraged to partner with a healthcare provider or EHR vendor for activities such as app development or pilot testing; evidence of partnership should be demonstrated with signed letters of intent on partner letterhead (i.e., we will not be reviewing actual business agreements).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>\n<p>To augment technical development and enhance the likelihood of a successful app that will continue to exist beyond the end of the challenge, a progress update/matchmaking event will be held that will seek to connect participants with provider partners. In Phase 1, up to five app proposals will be recognized as winners and awarded up to $15,000 each.</p>\n",

Congratulations to them all!</strong></p>\n<p>The Provider User-Experience (UX)&nbsp;Challenge incents&nbsp;the development of applications that use open, standardized APIs to enable innovative ways for providers to interact with patient health data. This challenge will focus on demonstrating how data made accessible to apps through APIs&nbsp;can positively impact providers&rsquo; experience with EHRs by making clinical workflows more intuitive, specific to clinical specialty, and actionable. The lack of interoperability between electronic health record (EHR) systems remains a significant barrier to the modernization of health IT.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources</a>&nbsp;(FHIR), developed by HL7, is a standard designed to increase the liquidity of granular patient data. The FHIR API allows data to move between vendor systems both within and across different providers, not to mention through third-party applications for direct use by both clinicians and consumers. Among several opportunities now enabled by this interoperability standard are the new channels being opened up for improving a provider&rsquo;s user experience when interacting with EHRs and the &ldquo;consumability&rdquo; of interrelated health data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>***Watch the recording of the March 31&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/1SLG1gB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Informational Webinar</a>***</strong></p>\n<p>The challenge has two phases. Phase 1 requires the submission of technical and business plans for the application (app) while Phase 2 requires that a working app be available for consumers. Phase 2 of the competition will not be limited to only those who won Phase 1 &ndash; all Phase 1 competitors, and those who did not participate in Phase 1, can submit a final app at the end of Phase 2.&nbsp;The final application must meet the following requirements:</p>\n<ul> <li>Uses FHIR Draft Standard for Technical Use 2 (DSTU2)</li> <li>Leverages&nbsp;data as specified in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/commonclinicaldataset_ml_11-4-15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Data column</a>)</li> <li>Verified compatibility with different health IT developer systems implemented in production settings, 1 of which must be from the top 10 systems measured by Meaningful Use attestation per HealthIT.gov. Apps must be integrated with a minimum of 3 unique health IT developer systems in 2 unique provider settings. There are two options to assess MU attestation here, by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Professionals.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Healthcare Professionals</a> or by <a href=\"http://dashboard.healthit.gov/quickstats/pages/FIG-Vendors-of-EHRs-to-Participating-Hospitals.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hospitals</a>. The top 10 system can be selected from Primary EHR Vendor &ndash; not Secondary EHR Vendor &ndash; in either of these reports.</li> <li>Has been tested with users&nbsp;in production settings</li> <li>Available to providers&nbsp;through at least one of the following modes:&nbsp; direct from&nbsp;web, iOS Store, or Android Stores</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>The second phase, to run from&nbsp;June 2 to November 7, will entail the actual development of the apps, verification of technical capabilities, user testing/piloting, and public release of the apps. This will include remote testing with providers and health IT developers to test the technical abilities of the apps to connect to in-production systems. Participants will submit:</p>\n<ul> <li>Working app:&nbsp; Provide the url to download/access the app.</li> <li>Video demonstrating the app (maximum of 5 minutes)</li> <ul> <li>Provide the url of the video on YouTube or Vimeo.</li> <li>The video must highlight the use of FHIR to integrate with EHR vendor systems, including demonstration of data exchange with each system. The rest of the video should address the remaining evaluation criteria:&nbsp; functionality and quality of data aggregation, privacy and security of patient data, impact potential in a clinical setting,&nbsp;and user experience and visual appeal.</li> </ul> <li>Slide deck describing app (maximum of 15 slides):&nbsp; Overall, the slide deck should complement the video demonstration. It should include a list of the active FHIR integrations with EHRs at provider settings, as demonstrated in the video. It should describe other functionality pertaining to the review criteria, particularly anything that was not covered in the video.</li> </ul>\n<p>The grand prize winner will receive $50,000 and a second place winner will receive $25,000. There will be an additional $25,000 prize for the app that connects to the greatest number of unique health IT developer systems implemented in production settings (the \"Ultimate Connector\"), which can be won by any entry, including the grand prize or 2nd place winner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 Participation Requirements</strong></p>\n<p>Participants interested in competing for Phase 1 awards will need to submit an app development plan that must include:</p>\n<ul> <li>Mockup/wireframes of the app:&nbsp; Provide a clear sense of the look, feel, and interactions of the app.</li> <li>Technical specifications, including but not limited to planned data sources, system architecture, and compliance with HIPAA regulations (and other applicable law):&nbsp; Provide a realistic idea of what data sources, and from who, will be included; how that data will be integrated together and in service to the consumer&rsquo;s needs; how data privacy and security will be implemented.</li> <li>Business/sustainability plan:&nbsp; How does the submitter propose to enter the market and lead to a successful app? The plan should include the following:</li> <ol> <li>Issue analysis, demonstrating understanding of the issue (1 page)</li> <li>Solution description, describing the solution and how it addresses the issues (2 pages)</li> <li>Financial estimates, including revenues and expenses (2 pages)</li> <li>Engagement plan, including targeted customer base and stakeholders (2 pages)</li> </ol> <li>Provider partnership:&nbsp; Submitters are strongly encouraged to partner with a healthcare provider or EHR vendor for activities such as app development or pilot testing; evidence of partnership should be demonstrated with signed letters of intent on partner letterhead (i.e., we will not be reviewing actual business agreements).</li> </ul>\n<p>To augment technical development and enhance the likelihood of a successful app that will continue to exist beyond the end of the challenge, a progress update/matchmaking event will be held that will seek to connect participants with provider partners. In Phase 1, up to five app proposals will be recognized as winners and awarded up to $15,000 each.</p>\n",

These specifications empower people to control the authorization of access to health-related data sharing APIs.</p>\n<p>Participants are expected to engage people to test the implementation of the Solution and make possible processes that need consumers to authorize the release of their health data to a destination they choose. Participants must recruit individuals and obtain their authorizations to test the implementation of the Solution using their health data. The data for the API and Solution should be provided by Phase 2 finalists.</p>\n<p>The Challenge will have three phases and two finalists each winning $75,000. Phase 1 will award $5,000 for up 10 finalists each based on the proposals they submit to the Challenge. Phase 1 winners will move to Phase 2, which will award $20,000 for up to 5 finalists each based on the prototype of their Solution. Phase 2 winners will move to Phase 3, which will award $50,000 for up to two winners each based on the participant&rsquo;s ability to implement their Solution.</p>\n<p>This multi-phased approach allows participants to assemble, implement and test their Solutions. The final phase of the Challenge will require finalists to show a consumer-facing Solution that incorporates the HEART implementation specifications and uses an API that empowers consumers to control the movement of their health data.</p>\n<p>This Challenge encourages participants to apply independently or team with others including health IT developers, health care providers and other entities with the appropriate expertise related to this Solution. Lessons learned and the Challenge&rsquo;s results will be shared in order to support other organizations implementing solutions that make possible consumer-mediated exchange.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Questions about the Move Health Data Forward Challenge can be posted to the Discussion section and will be regularly monitored.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 &ndash; Proposals&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The Proposal Phase allows participants to present Solutions that increase consumers&rsquo; access to and sharing of their information within electronic health record systems. In this phase, participants should describe the technical, operational, financial and business aspects of their proposed Solution.

Our response to the AMR Challenge is to produce a test that both confirms bacteremia caused by highly resistant strains, and provides a complete phenotypical antibiotic susceptibility test (AST) in a time that is radically shorter than today&rsquo;s clinical standard. The test employs a microfluidic sensor that counts and weighs individual microbes at high throughput, and robustly measures bacterial culture growth at a speed limited only by the growth of the microbes themselves. It will provide clinically actionable information - confirming the presence of highly resistant bacteria and identifying the best targeted therapies - in hours or even minutes, vs. the current standard of 2-3 days. The initial targets will be CRE and ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae, but the test will be extensible to all high-value bacterial targets and any desired antibiotics, and to a variety of bodily sources of infection (e.g., bacteremia/sepsis, spinal and pleural fluid, urinary tract, etc.) Because it assesses growth phenotypically, the test will not be defeated by evolving resistance mechanisms, and will provide an essential complement to resistance biomarkers and organism identification. The outcome will be the fastest possible sample-to result phenotypical susceptibility test, with the potential to migrate from a laboratory/in-patient setting to the doctor&rsquo;s office.</p>\n<p><strong>Becton, Dickinson and Company</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Becton, Dickinson and Company (BD) seeks to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics by guiding healthcare practitioners in differentiating between bacterial and viral infections within the time constraints of a single outpatient visit. Building on the public-health utility and broad commercial success of the BD Veritor&trade; platform, we are developing a novel digital immunoassay (DIA) that will measure a panel of circulating host immune biomarkers from a single blood-based sample. The test is intended to be an aid in the management of patients with symptoms of infection &ndash; such as upper respiratory infection &ndash; for which antibiotic misuse is a widespread problem. By providing objective diagnostic evidence that the patient&rsquo;s immune system is fighting either a bacterial or a viral infection, the test will return an informative result without requiring a sample from the site of infection, and without the time or expense of diagnostic confirmation of numerous possible candidate pathogens. By employing the sample-in/result-out, one-button simplicity of the CLIA-waived BD Veritor system, the test can be deployed broadly at point-of-care settings without the need for trained personnel. And by returning a result rapidly (target of ten minutes) at the point of care, the test outcome will enable an actionable decision before the patient leaves the site.</p>\n<p><strong>Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, with 430--‐ 450 million cases and 3--‐ 4 million deaths per year. In the United States alone, there are 4--‐ 5 million CAP cases, 1.1 million hospitalizations, and over 52,000 deaths annually, accounting for over $34 billion in direct health expenditures. Despite the high incidence of CAP, existing diagnostic tests for CAP are inadequate, identifying an underlying microbial pathogen in only 7--‐ 38% of cases. Even when a specific causal pathogen is identified, results often return long after it is necessary to make a clinical treatment decision. Because of the difficulty of identifying the microbial cause of pneumonia and the potentially severe consequences of not treating bacterial pneumonia promptly, clinicians often treat CAP empirically with antibiotics, even though a large proportion of these cases are viral in etiology. Unnecessary broad--‐ spectrum antibiotic prescriptions per year, in turn, fuel the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria, including most of the urgent and serious threat level pathogens on the Center for</p>\n<p><strong>Click Diagnostics, Inc.</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Click Diagnostics was founded with the mission to dramatically improve health outcomes through innovative new diagnostic technology providing physicians with &ldquo;patient-side&rdquo; test results enabling immediate and accurate treatment. Through dramatic miniaturization, optimization, and cost reduction of laboratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, we have created a fast, inexpensive, easy-to-use, single-use (disposable) diagnostic device. Think &ldquo;home pregnancy test,&rdquo; but for nearly &ldquo;any infectious disease.&rdquo; Click has made patient-side testing for infectious diseases almost as simple as taking a patient&rsquo;s blood pressure. We expect this to revolutionize health testing, moving molecular testing from laboratories and large healthcare facilities to doctors&rsquo; offices and clinics, and eventually the home. Because the Click device is fundamentally a PCR assay, products can be developed for most common infectious diseases such as sexually transmitted infections (STI), hospital-acquired infections (HAI), and respiratory infections. Our first product for detecting the STIs gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis is scheduled for clinical trial in 2017. As part of the AMR challenge, we plan to add a test for drug resistant gonorrhea to this panel. The CDC identifies drug resistant gonorrhea as an urgent threat due to high levels of drug resistance and potential impact on public health (1).</p>\n<p><strong>Duke University</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Inappropriately prescribed antibacterials for viral respiratory illness contribute to increased healthcare costs, unnecessary drug-related adverse effects, and drive antimicrobial resistance. The inability to rapidly and reliably distinguish bacterial from viral or non-infectious etiologies is a major impediment to appropriate antibiotic use. Pathogen detection strategies can be helpful but are limited by poor sensitivity, long time-to-result, inability to distinguish infection from colonization, or restricted number of target pathogens. Peptide biomarkers such as procalcitonin may also be helpful but are poorly sensitive and specific. Consequently, these approaches have not adequately addressed the antibacterial overuse problem. We therefore propose an innovative solution focusing on the patient&rsquo;s response to infection. New scientific advances can now capture the entirety of the host response using system-wide molecular surveys (e.g., RNA, proteins, metabolites). We have developed analytical methods to define the stereotyped responses found within these highly complex and dense data. Applying these techniques to infection, we have shown the pattern of immune system response can distinguish bacterial, viral, and non-infectious etiologies. That response is most robustly detected in the patient&rsquo;s gene expression profile, which is far more accurate than existing diagnostic tests. This strategy is only useful, however, if it can be measured rapidly, simply, and at the point-of-need. Supported by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group, Duke University and BioFire Diagnostics now propose such a test. This simple-to-use, 1-hour test distinguishes bacterial infection, viral infection, or neither so as to guide the appropriate administration of antibacterials at the point-of-need.</p>\n<p><strong>First Light Biosciences, Inc.</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>First Light Biosciences is addressing two critical issues in healthcare:&nbsp; the rise in superbugs that are re-sistant to most antibiotics and the epidemic of hospital acquired infections. Today, a large fraction of life threatening infections seen in hospitals are caused by pathogens that are resistant to multiple anti-biotics. Effective treatment and cure requires rapid diagnostics to detect infections and select appropri-ate antibiotics for treatment. Unfortunately, no such tests exist today. We propose to develop tests based on First Light&rsquo;s MultiPath technology that can rapidly and affordably detect a broad range of in-fections, accurately identify the infectious agents, and determine the appropriate antibiotic for treat-ment. The MultiPath platform consists of an automated benchtop analyzer that accommodates a broad menu of application-specific consumable cartridges. The MultiPath technology is quantitative. In only 15 min it detects infections and identifies pathogens including bacteria, fungi, viruses, toxins, human cells, and biomarkers. The technology can determine the correct antibiotic therapy in just 4 hours in contrast to the several days required by current methods. While as sensitive as high performance cen-tral laboratory tests, the MultiPath tests are as rapid and as easy-to-use as point-of-care tests and re-quire no sample preparation. The proprietary MultiPath technology achieves high sensitivity and quan-tification by using digital non-magnified imaging to count fluorescently labeled cellular and molecular targets. The MultiPath Platform eliminates labile enzymatic reagents, biochemical purification, and liq-uid handling (including wash steps), reducing complexity and cost while increasing throughput. We pro-pose to develop high-performance easy-to-use tests for important diagnostic applications for initial commercialization in the hospital setting. The platform and tests will also have commercial and medical advantages in outpatient settings. For Step 2, we plan to:&nbsp; (1) develop MultiPath assays for Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) diagnostics, multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance, and urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostics, (2) develop the MultiPath consumable cartridges for the three tests, (3) develop the benchtop automated MultiPath Analyzer, and (4) demonstrate the performance of the integrated MultiPath Analyzer and MultiPath Tests.</p>\n<p><strong>Philips North America</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Neutrophil Lipocalin (HNL) on a diagnostic platform from a single drop of human blood. In 2015 the concept was successfully demonstrated with blood samples from patients with acute fever where in only minutes patients with a bacterial infection could clearly be distinguished from those without. To make this marker available in the primary care setting, Philips is working to realize the whole blood based assay onto its Minicare system. The CE-marked Minicare system is a platform for rapid blood testing, consisting of a point-of-care analyser and cartridges supporting different types of tests. Finalization of product development is estimated at 2.5 - 3 years. Penn will confirm performance of the biomarker using U.S. clinical samples in a separate study. Once test development is complete, Penn will serve as the clinical study site to validate and register the test and to perform a health technology assessment measuring its impact in reducing unnecessary prescription of antibiotics.</p>\n<p><strong>Spectral Labs, Inc.</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>We propose InSpector-01 (~ a rapid test for characterizing the presence/absence of pathogenic microorganisms in blood and urine samples) and InSpector-02 (~ a rapid test for characterizing the functional MIC minimum inhibitory concentration of a candidate antimicrobial required to suppress the growth of the causative pathogen, even prior to that pathogen being isolated and identified). InSpector-01 would be used to test blood and urine samples, both in the outpatient and in the inpatient setting, and would identify patients for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate. Thus, InSpector-01 can reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use for the vast majority of patients who are currently treated with antimicrobials, but who are uninfected. InSpector-02 would be used to characterize blood samples in the inpatient setting for the functional MIC of the causative pathogen, so as to guide subsequent antimicrobial therapy (from the 2nd antimicrobial dose on). Both InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 offer unique capabilities ~ we are not aware of any other current/emerging methods that can identify patients for whom antimicrobial therapy is inappropriate (as InSpector-01 does) or current/emerging methods that can provide the functional MIC (as InSpector-02 does; other methods provide markers of specific resistance mechanisms). Both InSpector-01 and InSpector-02 are at an advanced stage of development, and are currently being field tested to develop a quality system necessary for distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>University of Rochester</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>More accurate tests for microbiologic diagnosis of acute respiratory infections (ARI) are needed. Acute respiratory infections occur commonly throughout life, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality in adults, and these infections are a leading cause of antibiotic overuse. Unnecessary antibiotic use is a major driver of the increase in antimicrobial resistance, which is considered to be one of the most urgent threats to global public health. In most cases of ARI, the precise microbial etiology is unknown and antibiotics are administered empirically in illness in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Although sensitive molecular diagnostics such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) allow clinicians to rapidly and accurately diagnose a wide variety of respiratory viruses, their impact on patient management and antibiotic prescription has been modest primarily due to concern about bacterial co-infection. Sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for bacterial lung infection are currently lacking. Clinical parameters such as fever, purulent sputum, white blood cell count and radiographic patterns do not provide sufficient precision to reliably distinguish viral from bacterial infections. Thus, &ldquo;ruling out&rdquo; bacterial respiratory infection is extremely difficult, resulting in a default position of prescribing antibiotics to almost all patients hospitalized with respiratory infection and many outpatients as well. This practice results in significant antibiotic overuse, with resultant adverse effects and increased antimicrobial resistance. Recently, serum biomarkers such as procalcitonin have shown some promise as a supplement to clinical judgment in assessing patients with ARI but a need for more accurate tests remains. Gene expression profiling of whole blood represents a powerful new approach for analysis of the host response during infection. Preliminary studies indicate that viruses and bacteria may trigger specific host transcriptional patterns in blood, yielding unique &ldquo;bio-signatures&rdquo; that may discriminate viral from bacterial causes of infection. This approach can be used to supplement pathogen detection allowing clinicians to target antibiotic use for those patients that need treatment and thereby reducing unnecessary antibiotic use and resultant antimicrobial resistance. New rapid molecular diagnostics that incorporate detection of common respiratory viruses and bacteria combined with a limited number host genes discriminatory for bacterial and viral infection will be developed. The eventual goal is to simplify testing such that point of care ARI diagnostics can be employed in hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics and physicians&rsquo; offices for the maximal impact on patient care and antibiotic prescription.</p>\n<p><strong>Yale University</strong></p>\n<p>$50,000.00</p>\n<p>Every year, citizens of the United States experience more than one billion infections of the upper respiratory tract. Both viruses and bacteria can cause these illnesses but only bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics. However, we do not have a simple, rapid, comprehensive diagnostic test to distinguish between viral and bacterial upper respiratory infections. Lack of such tests contributes to the fact that outpatient visits for acute respiratory infection are the most common setting for inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in the U.S, with about half of these prescriptions (~35 million prescriptions annually) not indicated1. Our recent findings indicate a way to develop a diagnostic test to rapidly distinguish between viral and bacterial causes of respiratory illness while the patient is in the doctor&rsquo;s office. Unlike current tests, which detect the presence of specific viruses, this approach measures the response of the patient&rsquo;s airway cells to the infection to indicate whether the body is fighting a viral infection or a bacterial infection. This approach has two major advantages over current approaches:&nbsp; (1) many different viruses and bacteria can cause similar respiratory symptoms, but the only tests currently available are pathogen-specific. Therefore a single test can easily miss the organism causing the patient&rsquo;s illness, and testing for large panels of pathogens is complex and can be prohibitively expensive; (2) unlike other proposed approaches to distinguish viral and bacterial infections based on the body&rsquo;s response, our approach does not require a blood sample, but will work with a nose or throat swab. This test has tremendous potential to transform ingrained practices of prescribing antibiotics for non-bacterial illnesses by demonstrating the cause of infection to physician and patient during the initial healthcare encounter, and therefore will provide a powerful tool for promoting antimicrobial stewardship.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Did you know that every year the Federal government&nbsp;invests over $135 billion in research and development? Almost one-third of these funds support intramural research - by Federal researchers within Federal laboratories - covering a wide range of technologies with applications in aerospace, biotechnology, chemical engineering, communications, electronics, and much, much more. Many of the technologies developed by Federal researchers are transferred to the private sector through formal agreements (e.g. patents, licenses, or cooperative research and development agreements) or through informal exchanges (e.g. publications, conference presentations or collaborations).&nbsp;Without doubt these Federal investments have yielded extraordinary long-term impacts, creating new knowledge and ultimately new industries. But we need more efforts to quantify these impacts. How can we most accurately and completely capture the economic and societal impact&nbsp;of federal technology transfer activities?&nbsp;This challenge calls on you to analyze a federally-developed technology that has been transferred to the private sector, and present the results in a paper suitable for an archival publication.</p>\n<p><strong>Why this Challenge?</strong></p>\n<p>Despite the proliferation of Federal research and the profound effect that many Federally-developed technologies have upon our everyday life, more effort is needed&nbsp;to assess the impact of these technologies -- as emphasized in President Obama's <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/10/28/presidential-memorandum-accelerating-technology-transfer-and-commerciali\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2011 Memorandum Accelerating Technology Transfer and Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth Businesses</a>. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Journal of Technology Transfer aim to stimulate efforts in this area through this Challenge.</p>\n<p><strong>What is a Federally developed technology?</strong></p>\n<p>Eligible technologies for this Challenge must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology must have been developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the course of their employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the technology must have been transferred in a manner that can be traced back to the agency.&nbsp;Information about federally transferred technologies and technology transfer success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href=\"http://www.federallabs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.federallabs.org</a>. &nbsp; See&nbsp;a list of Federal agencies that prepare annual <a href=\"http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">technology transfer reports</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I assess one?</strong></p>\n<p>The objective of this Challenge is to identify and measure economic and societal impacts&nbsp;that result from the transfer of&nbsp;Federally developed technologies.</p>\n<ul> <li>First, &nbsp;identify a technology that was developed in a Federal agency. Information about federally transferred technologies can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href=\"http://www.federallabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.federallabs.org</a> as well as individual Federal agency websites, including NIST's <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technology Partnerships Office</a>. NIST provides&nbsp;a <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo/agency-technology-transfer-reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">list of Federal agencies that issue annual technology transfer reports</a>.</li> <li>Next, research the impact of this technology by examining&nbsp;who is using the technology,&nbsp;how they are using it, and what impacts have resulted from its use.&nbsp; Impacts may be assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic data or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security).</li> <li>Finally,&nbsp;prepare an original paper describing your research and the impact that you have identified. Your paper should clearly describe the technology you are assessing and include evidence of how it has been used since being transferred. &nbsp;Note that a variety of assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this Challenge including, but not limited to, <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo/nist-economic-impact-studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIST's economic impact studies</a> and these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/tpo/other-agency-economic-impact-studies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">examples of commonly used approaches</a>.</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Who should participate?</strong></p>\n<p>This Challenge is open to anyone (or any organization) that meets the eligibility requirements described in the Rules. You do not need to be a technology expert or economist,&nbsp;but you should have an appetite for research and some familiarity with methods of impact analysis. Teaming is encouraged because of the scope and diversity of potential technology transfer studies, from understanding the technology to tracking its transfer&nbsp;and assessing its impact.</p>\n<p><strong>To enter:</strong></p>\n<p>Submit a research paper that identifies a federally developed technology and analyzes the economic or social or economic impact that occurred as a result of it being transferred outside of the federal agency in which it was developed.&nbsp; If your paper is selected as a winner, you will receive a $5,000 cash award and you will be invited to have your paper considered for publication in&nbsp;<em>The Journal of Technology Transfer</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Before you begin,&nbsp;carefully review the Rules to make sure you are eligible to Participate and for more details&nbsp;about&nbsp;the Challenge.

In an effort to encourage research in this area, the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the <em>Journal of Technology Transfer</em> present a Federal Impact Assessment (FIA) Challenge for researchers to develop impact studies of Federal technology transfer activities. The FIA Challenge calls on researchers to perform original retrospective studies that assess the impact of federally developed technologies that 1) have been developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) have been transferred to an entity other than the agency which developed the technology.</p>\n<p><strong>DATES:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p><em>Submission Period:&nbsp; </em>September 27, 2016 -&nbsp;March 31, 2017</p>\n<p><em>Announcement of Winners:&nbsp; </em>April 28, 2017</p>\n<p>The Submission Period begins September 27,&nbsp;2016, at 9:00 AM Eastern Time (ET) and ends March 31, 2017, at 5:00 PM ET.&nbsp; Prize competition dates are subject to change at the discretion of NIST. &nbsp;Entries submitted before or after the Submission Period will not be reviewed or considered for award. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>FOR </strong><strong>FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</strong> Changes or updates to the prize competition rules will be posted and can be viewed at the Event Website, <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge</a>.</p>\n<p>Questions about the prize competition can be directed to NIST via the Event Website&nbsp;or by email to Michael Walsh at michael.walsh@nist.gov, phone 301-975-5455.</p>\n<p>Results of the prize competition will be announced on the Event Website&nbsp;and on the NIST website, www.nist.gov. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>FIA Challenge Sponsors</strong></p>\n<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST; <a href=\"http://www.nist.gov\">www.nist.gov</a>) is a non-regulatory Federal agency within the United States Department of Commerce.

Any individuals or legal entities that have received Federal funds for the development of any part of a submission are ineligible.&nbsp; Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of the FIA Challenge, are also not eligible to participate.</p>\n<p>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the FIA Challenge if the employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis. &nbsp;Note that while Federal employees may provide information to Participants they are not obligated to respond to information requests within the time frame of this Challenge. The task of gathering information for this Challenge in a timely manner is the sole responsibility of the Participant.</p>\n<p>To be eligible to win a Cash Award, a Participant (whether an individual or legal entity) must have registered to participate and must have complied with all requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code (&ldquo;Prize competitions&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>Multiple entries are permitted. &nbsp;Each entry will be reviewed independently. &nbsp;Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a group to submit a single entry, in which case all members of the group must satisfy the eligibility requirements, and a single individual from the group must be designated as an official representative for each entry.&nbsp; That designated individual will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. &nbsp;Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations.&nbsp; Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Entry Process for Participants</strong></p>\n<p>To enter, visit the Event Website, <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/federal-impact-assessment-challenge</a>. Submit a Federal Impact Assessment (hereafter, &ldquo;Paper&rdquo;) that meets the selection criteria described below.</p>\n<p>The FIA Challenge calls on Participants to write an original Paper describing a retrospective assessment of the economic and/or societal impacts resulting from the transfer of a Federal technology developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at any time over the past 30 years.</p>\n<p>For this FIA Challenge, &ldquo;Federal technologies&rdquo; are those techniques, machines, articles of manufacture, compositions of matter, methods, processes, tools, or works of authorship, whether or not patentable or copyrightable, that were invented or developed in whole or in part by one or more Federal employees during the course of their employment duties.</p>\n<p>Transfer of a Federal technology (technology transfer) is the use of that technology by an entity outside of the agency where the Federal employee(s) was assigned.&nbsp; There are many different means by which the Federal government seeks to transfer technologies. Technologies can be transferred through formal agreements (e.g., licenses, or Cooperative Research and Development Agreements) or through informal exchanges (e.g., publications, conference presentations or informal collaborations).</p>\n<p>Eligible technologies must meet two criteria, namely 1) the technology must have been developed in whole or in part by a Federal employee(s) during the course of his or her employment duties at any time over the past 30 years, and 2) the technology must have been transferred outside the Federal agency in a manner that can be traced back to that Federal agency. Technologies that have been developed entirely outside of a Federal agency or that have been developed entirely by non-Federal employees (even though with federal funding) are not eligible. Technologies that have not been transferred by a Federal agency are also not eligible.&nbsp; Information about federally transferred technologies and technology transfer success stories can be found on the Federal Laboratories Consortium (FLC) website at <a href=\"http://www.federallabs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.federallabs.org</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;For a list of Federal agencies that prepare annual technology transfer reports, see <a href=\"http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/agency-technology-transfer-reports.cfm</a>.</p>\n<p>For the FIA Challenge, it is envisioned that impacts of a given Federal technology(ies) are determined by an assessment of repercussions that have accrued to those who have either utilized Federal technologies in research or development activities, and/or consumed goods or services enabled by Federal technologies.&nbsp; The objective of the FIA Challenge is to develop metrics that measure economic and societal impacts. These metrics will then be available to stakeholders and policy makers to evaluate the net impact of federally developed technologies (i.e., impact less development costs).<a href=\"#_ftn1\" name=\"_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp; Impacts may be assessed at the local, regional, national, or global levels using economic data or other societal data (e.g., measures of health, safety, or security).&nbsp; A variety of assessment methodologies could be used by Participants in this Challenge.&nbsp; Examples of commonly used approaches can be found in the citations provided by NIST online at <a href=\"http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/other-economic-impact-related-studies.cfm\">http://nist.gov/tpo/publications/other-economic-impact-related-studies.cfm</a>.</p>\n<p>Papers submitted to this challenge that have previously been published or that have been prepared using Federal funds are not eligible (e.g., Federal agency reports, reports prepared by Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, or reports prepared by funded intermediaries on behalf of Federal agencies.)</p>\n<p>A complete Entry includes your Paper (including any figures, tables, and references), the email address of the Participant who is officially representing the Entry, and confirmation that you have read and agree to the Competition Rules contained in this Notice. &nbsp;Participants may provide submissions beginning at 9:00 AM ET on September&nbsp;27<sup>th</sup>, 2016, to the Event Website.&nbsp; Submission can be made no later than 5:00 PM ET on March 31, 2017, to the Event Website. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Submissions before the start date and time, or after the end date and time, will not be evaluated or considered for award.&nbsp; Entries sent to NIST in any manner other than through the Event Website will not be evaluated or considered for award.&nbsp; Entries that do not comply with the formatting requirements set forth in this Notice will not be evaluated or considered for award.</p>\n<p>Entries must be complete, must contain no confidential information and must be in English.</p>\n<p>In general, each Entry:</p>\n<p>a) must affirmatively represent that the Participant (and each Participant if more than one) has read and consents to be governed by the Competition rules and meets the eligibility requirements;</p>\n<p>b) must include an original Paper not prepared using Federal funds. Specifically, the Paper must:</p>\n<ol> <li>include the author(s) and the name and email address of the official representative,</li> <li>include text, figures, tables and references that describes a retrospective impact assessment of a federally developed technology(ies),</li> <li>be an original work not previously published in any media (i.e., including but not limited to printed or otherwise reproduced text/graphics for sale or distribution to the public),</li> <li>be a single file submitted in .doc, .docx, or .pdf format with text, figures, tables, and references contained within the Paper. There is no page limit,</li> <li>provide an assessment of the economic and/or societal impacts of a technology or technologies that have been developed completely or in part by Federal researchers working at any Federal agency at any time over the past 30 years, and must have been transferred from a Federal agency,</li> <li>provide a complete description of the impact methodology, including a description of the metrics used for the impact assessment. Citations of Federal technologies must be provided, for example by listing patent numbers, as well as citations of the transfer of the technologies to the private sector, for example by listing products and companies using licensed Federal technologies,</li> <li>meet the Evaluation Criteria described below in the Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s) sections, and</li> <li>include original figures, tables, and text passages or, if any of these have been published elsewhere, Participants must have obtained written permission, at Participants&rsquo; sole expense, from the copyright owner(s) for both the irrevocable use and distribution by NIST of the figure, tables, or text passages, in both print and online formats and evidence that such permission has been granted must be provided in the Paper. Any material received without such evidence will be assumed to originate from the authors;</li> </ol>\n<p>c) must include in a separate section on the title page of the Paper, an acknowledgement of any individuals, grants, funds, or other entities that provided support for the Paper.

The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website and published in the Federal Register.&nbsp; The Prize Purse will be used to fund one or more awards.</p>\n<p>NIST will announce via the Event Website any Entry(ies) as to which the Judges have made a cash award (each, an &ldquo;Award&rdquo;).&nbsp; The anticipated number and amount of the Awards that will be awarded for this Competition is set forth in this Federal Register Notice; however, the Judges are not obligated to make all or any Awards, and reserve the right to award fewer than the anticipated number of Awards in the event an insufficient number of eligible Entries meet any one or more of the Judging Criteria for this Competition, based on the Judges' evaluation of the quality of Entries and in their sole discretion.&nbsp; Awards will be made based on the Judges&rsquo; evaluation of an Entry&rsquo;s compliance with the Judging Criteria for this Competition.&nbsp; All potential winners will be notified by the e-mail address provided in the submission document and may be required to complete further documentation confirming their eligibility.&nbsp; Return of any notification as &ldquo;undeliverable&rdquo; will result in disqualification.&nbsp; After verification of eligibility, Awards will be distributed in the form of a check or electronic funds transfer addressed to the official representative specified in the winning Entry.&nbsp; That official representative will have sole responsibility for further distribution of any Award among Participants in a group Entry or within a company or institution that has submitted an Entry through that representative.&nbsp; Each list of Entries receiving Awards for the Competition will be made public according to the timeline outlined on the Event Website.</p>\n<p>Winners are responsible for all taxes and reporting related to any Award received as part of the Competition.</p>\n<p>All costs incurred in the preparation of Competition Entries are to be borne by Participants. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Evaluation, Judging, and Selection of Winner(s)</strong></p>\n<p><em>Submission Evaluation Criteria </em></p>\n<p>This section discusses how Participant submissions will be evaluated.</p>\n<p><em>Entry Submission and Review</em></p>\n<p>The requirements for submission of a complete Entry are detailed in the section &ldquo;Entry Process for Participants.&rdquo; &nbsp;Each Paper will be reviewed by up to three subject matter experts.&nbsp; Each subject matter expert will assess how well the Paper addressed each of the following evaluation criteria. For each criterion, subject matter experts will assign a numerical score and will provide a brief (50 to 100 word) assessment of how well that criterion was met.</p>\n<p><em>Evaluation Criteria</em></p>\n<ol> <li>Description of the technology. (20 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must include a description of the technology being analyzed. In addition to describing the function and purpose of the technology, the description must also identify where and when the technology was developed, when the technology was transferred, and how the technology was transferred. Papers will be evaluated based on the presentation of a clear and adequate description of the technology being assessed.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\"> <li>Description of the demand environment. (30 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must include a description of the demand environment. The demand environment is the environment in which the technology is utilized after it has been transferred from the agency. Papers should describe the types and number of individuals and/or organizations that utilize the technology.&nbsp; This should include researchers, consumers, and companies that make up the markets and industries affected. Papers will be evaluated based on the presentation of a clear and adequate description of the demand environment.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\"> <li>Description of methodologies used to gather and assess impact data. (20 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must include a description of how impact data was gathered and assessed. This includes a description of all data sources, techniques used to clean, adjust or normalize data, and statistical methods employed.&nbsp; Papers will be evaluated based on the creativity and appropriateness of the methodology used to gather data and assess impacts.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\"> <li>Description of the economic and/or societal impacts that resulted from the technology transferred from the Federal agency. (30 points)</li> </ol>\n<p>Papers must describe the economic and/or societal impact that resulted from the utilization of the technology once transferred from the agency. The description must be based on the evidence gathered and the statistical method(s) used to assess impacts in the demand environment. The description must include clearly defined metrics that allow for the benchmarking of impacts over time. Papers will be evaluated based on the degree to which reported impacts are presented in an accurate, unbiased, comprehensive, and convincing manner.</p>\n<p>Up to 15 Papers will be selected for evaluation by the Judges. Selected papers will be the lesser of either (1) all papers with an average subject matter expert score of 70 or higher, or (2) the top 15 papers with the highest average subject matter expert scores.</p>\n<p>A panel of three judges will then be convened to rank the selected Papers. Judges will review each of the selected Papers and the corresponding reviews provided by subject matter experts. Judges will deliberate and then rank them using the following <strong>equally weighted</strong> Judging Criteria.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Novelty of the Approach</strong> &ndash; The extent to which each Paper describes a new, creative, or innovative approach to capturing the impact of a Federally funded technology(ies).</li> <li><strong>Scope of the Assessment</strong> &ndash; The extent to which each Paper addresses the scope of impact from the transfer of a Federally funded technology.</li> <li><strong>Quality of the Paper</strong> &ndash; The extent to which each Paper present a high-quality, well-reasoned and compelling argument for capturing the impact of a federal funded technology(ies).</li> </ul>\n<p>Participant(s) who submitted a Paper that is among the top four Papers ranked by the Judges will receive $5,000 and an invitation to have the Paper considered for publication in a special issue of<em> The Journal of Technology Transfer</em> (&ldquo;Journal&rdquo;), or another issue as determined by the Journal&rsquo;s editorial board. Participants accepting this invitation who submit their Paper to the Journal must comply with the Journal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Instructions for Authors.&rdquo; (See:<a href=\"http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/journal/10961\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.springer.com/business+%26+management/journal/10961</a>)</p>\n<p>Papers submitted will be peer-reviewed using the processes of the Journal, and acceptance for publication is wholly within the Journal&rsquo;s discretion, and is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p><em>Subject Matter Experts and Judging Panel</em></p>\n<p>Subject Matter Experts, to be selected by NIST, will, as a body, represent a high degree of experience with impact assessment and federally funded technologies. Subject Matter Experts will consist of Federal employees and will be subject matter experts in the technology field. Subject Matter Experts will not select winners of any awards.</p>\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of highly qualified Judges. The Judging Panel will consist of three individuals who are experts in the field of assessing economic or societal impacts. Judges will deliberate and rank Papers&nbsp;according to the Judging Criteria described above. The top four Papers&nbsp;ranked by the Judges will be selected to receive an Award. Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in this Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant.

The Grand Prize winner was selected from the three initial finalists&nbsp;by a panel of 12 users. We have also included additional acknowledgements for the teams that provided the best and the most unique graphical user interfaces (these results have also been posted on the OIG website at <a href=\"https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/\">https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/prize/</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Grand Prize Winner and Finalist:&nbsp; Doug Brown (Team Catalyst) </strong></p>\n<p>Overall, Team Catalyst's entry delivered the most intuitive user experience. The entry maintained the familiarity of the original RAT-STATS design while still finding room to add several new and useful features. For example, the entry included custom confidence intervals which allowed users to calculate confidence intervals at other than the standard 80, 90, or 95 percent confidence levels. The entry went beyond the 4 modules required by the contest and included functions for stratified attribute samples and for generating sets of random numbers. As with the other finalists, the Team Catalyst entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Finalist:&nbsp; Murray Miron </strong></p>\n<p>Among a number of notable new features, Murray's entry included an integrated help system that connected relevant help information with each input element within the software. The accessibility of the information greatly reduced the need for users to refer back to a separate help screen or manual. Murray's entry also included the fastest algorithm for calculating exact confidence intervals for large attribute samples. In addition, the entry went beyond the four required modules to also include a function for determining the sample size of a design given an estimated error rate. As with the other finalists, Murray's entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Finalist:&nbsp; Dave&nbsp;Kaniss and Tim Kaniss (Team ENGRdynamics) </strong></p>\n<p>Team ENGRdyanmics' simplified the original RAT-STATS Design by combining the stratified and unrestricted variable appraisal functions into a single module. The combined module had an elegant design and was still very effective in accounting for the differences between the stratified and unrestricted analyses. The team also included a number of additional useful new features such as the ability to import files by dragging them into the target input field. &nbsp;As with the other finalists, the Team ENGRdynamics' entry was able to replicate RAT-STATS on 60 test cases and met the key requirements for 508 compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>Best Graphical User Interface - Corey Berry and Aja Berry (Team CBTek)</strong></p>\n<p>The graphical user interface for CBTek's entry looked great, met 508 compliance standards, and allowed for easy access to all key program functions and operations. The interface had the added advantage that it was customizable to fit the needs of the individual user. Of final note, the team's splash screen and program icon were the best of all the entries submitted.</p>\n<p><strong>Graphic User Interface Honorable Mention &ndash; Sudeep Shouche and Premraj Narkhede (Team Dolcera)</strong></p>\n<p>Team Dolcera provided a unique entry which split several of the RAT-STATS modules into a series of steps. The component nature of the design simplified the input and made the function requirements easier to follow for new users.</p>\n<p><strong>Contest Rules and Description</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Important Note:</strong>&nbsp;Once five finalists have been identified, no further entries from teams not previously identified as finalists will be reviewed even if they are submitted prior to the May 15, 2017, 5:00 p.m. EST deadline.&nbsp; Moreover, the contest will end on May 15, 2017, at 5:00 p.m. EST even if fewer than five finalists have been selected.</p>\n<p>Finalists may update their entries without losing their finalist designation.

The newest entry from each team will be used for all judging purposes unless otherwise requested by the team.</p>\n<p><strong>Current Status:</strong>&nbsp;Status as of 3:00&nbsp;PM EST&nbsp;May&nbsp;31 2017:&nbsp;Three finalists.</p>\n<p><strong>Registration:</strong>&nbsp;To register for the competition, create an account on the&nbsp;challenge.gov website and send an email with the name(s) of your team member(s) to jared.smith@oig.hhs.gov.</p>\n<p><strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp;Each year HHS handles hundreds of millions of Medicare and Medicaid claims valued at over a trillion dollars. Due to the high volume of claims, statistical sampling provides a critical tool to ensure effective oversight of these expenditures. Sampling is used by the providers in their own efforts to monitor their performance and by the various organizations within HHS. There are a wide range of different software tools for performing statistical analysis. RAT-STATS has a unique niche in that it provides a straightforward tool for individuals who need a simple but robust method for selecting and analyzing statistical samples. The RAT-STATS software was originally created in 1978 and has gone through several upgrades since that time. Unlike a full statistical package that attempts to answer all types of questions for a wide range of users, RAT-STATS serves as a streamlined solution to handle the specific task of developing valid statistical samples and estimates within the healthcare oversight setting.</p>\n<p>For example, an OIG investigator may pull a simple random sample in order to estimate damages for a provider suspected of fraud. RAT-STATS generates valid pseudo-random numbers and outputs all of the information needed to replicate the sample. Once the investigator finishes reviewing the sample, he or she can then enter the results into RAT-STATS to get the final statistical estimate. While the investigator may need some basic training in statistics, he or she would not need the same level of expertise as would be required to navigate the many options available in a full service statistical or data analysis package.</p>\n<p>The objective of the current challenge is to develop the foundation for an upgraded version of RAT-STATS. The current version of RAT-STATS is well validated; however, its user interface can be difficult to navigate and the underlying code makes the software costly to update. OIG needs a new, modern version of the software that is easy to use and can be extended in a cost effective manner. In addition, the new version of the software must be 508 compliant.</p>\n<p>The current version of the RAT-STATS software can be found at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180501000101/http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp\">http://www.oig.hhs.gov/compliance/rat-stats/index.asp</a>.</p>\n",

To keep up, the National Science Foundation (NSF)&nbsp;plans to invest in its most critical resource &ndash; the workforce. And it's not just NSF. The need for an adaptable and ready workforce extends to other Federal agencies and beyond. No industry will be immune to the way advances in technology change the nature of work. As a pressing example, we are facing critical gaps in matching people with data science and cybersecurity skills with the right mission needs. NSF believes that, along with other agencies and organizations, the best way to maintain a workforce ready to carry out its mission is to encourage a culture of continuous learning, and to empower each person to refresh and modernize their skills toward future work. We want to spark the thinking of the best and brightest to co-create a solution that can enable individual skill-matching and tailored training for the Workforce for the 21st Century.</p> <p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/Future-Federal-Workforce.png\" width=\"742\" height=\"513\" alt=\"challenge vision for the future\" /></p> <p><strong><em>NSF has a vision.</em></strong></p> <p>Imagine a mechanism that rapidly enables an individual to match their skills and interests to current and future work opportunities, leveraging advanced technologies which incorporate learning and development needs (traditional, non-traditional, and experiential), and that provides direct access to options for obtaining the relevant expertise to ready the individual for the chosen work.&nbsp;</p> <p>The future world of work may not be recognizable yet, however a ready workforce will remain critical for both economic prosperity and mission accomplishment.&nbsp; Employers must start now to instill a culture of continuous learning in its most critical resource, the workforce. To do this, we must think creatively about broadening the pool of available candidates by lowering the barriers for access to opportunities. This journey begins with a mechanism that enables individuals to self-select and prepare for chosen work that complements their skills and interests. The future of work is one of continuous change, which depends on a culture of continuous learning.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>COMPETITION AIMS</strong></p> <p>This Career Compass Challenge is part of an effort to modernize the American workforce, but in order to do that we are focusing on the National Science Foundation as a model. This Challenge will address the changing nature of work, and the pace of change to the types of work, needed to carry out essential missions for the American people and create the Workforce for the 21st Century, starting with NSF. At the conclusion of this Challenge, NSF hopes to have created a \"market\" for technology solutions that will help employees plot a path for changing careers or identify how to move forward in their current career path, while also facilitating continuous reskilling.</p> <p>Moreover, the Career Compass Challenge will help inform further collaborative, cross-sector innovation that Federal agencies are pursuing more broadly, such as through the <a href=\"https://www.performance.gov/GEARcenter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Government Effectiveness Advanced Research&mdash;or GEAR&mdash;Center</a>. The GEAR Center will facilitate applied research to tackle management challenges at the Executive Branch enterprise level, confronting shared issues like workforce reskilling that cut across Federal agencies and other stakeholders. To the extent that this Career Compass Challenge is intended to explore creating a culture of a continuously ready workforce, on a small scale for NSF&mdash;by leveraging thought leaders across the American public, academia and industry&mdash;this challenge may be a model for learning how to successfully tackle other broad opportunities through a crowdsourced, test and learn model.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>We want to hear from you!</em></strong></p> <p>Let&rsquo;s explore innovative ways to expose opportunities for NSF employees, within NSF, across Federal Agencies, and even beyond the Government. Let's be creative about leveraging training methods that are broadly accessible and that empower each person to ready themselves to take advantage of available opportunities.&nbsp;</p> <p>Can you help us figure out a way to meet the workforce &ldquo;where they are at&rdquo;? Can you propose a solution available to anyone, at any time, from any device, in any location, and from any economic or educational background? Think NSF first, and then think beyond.&nbsp; This challenge is broadly applicable and the outcomes should be scalable.</p> <p><strong>COMPETITION OVERVIEW</strong></p> <p>The different types of roles and opportunities the Government offers the Federal workforce are more diverse than they have ever been, and the way federal staff work is changing. Federal employees no longer stay on a linear career path in the same field for most of their careers. Instead, many employees are branching out by making lateral moves into different fields. In addition, the pace of changes to the types of work that employees do, largely because of the ever-changing pace of technology, has increased dramatically over the past few years. It is difficult for agencies to identify and provide training for the workforce at the same rate of those changes. And it's likely that the Federal Government is not alone.</p> <p><em><strong>Part 1 (November 9, 2018 &ndash; February 13, 2019)</strong></em></p> <p>In <em>Part 1</em> of this challenge, solvers were asked to submit a concept white paper that describes a solution to the challenge of continuous workforce reskilling and the desire for increased mobility within and between NSF and other Federal agencies (and perhaps even the private sector), as an example. Solvers were asked to think creatively about methods that go beyond the traditional \"career path\" thinking and \"strategic workforce planning\" methodology when exposing future skill needs or opportunities for an individual's consideration when choosing a development path. Solvers are also asked to consider relevant research on adult cognition and reskilling, particularly for those that must \"work\" and \"learn\" simultaneously. Read the winning submissions in the PRIZES section.</p> <p><em><strong>Part 2 (April 15, 2019 - August 30, 2019)</strong></em></p> <p>In <em>Part 2</em>, solvers are encouraged to leverage and build upon winning concepts to develop a working prototype for Government testing and evaluation. Solvers need not register in Challenge.gov to participate.

For example, what is the traditional or cultural practice? How does it contribute to health and wellness in AI/AN populations?</li> <li>A description of how this tradition or culture affects people&rsquo;s lives. The impact could be lives saved, suffering reduced, fewer visits to health care facilities, adopting a healthier lifestyle, and similar such benefits. How is this practice promoted within tribal populations?</li> <li>Information about the unmet health and wellness needs of AI/AN communities. What is the unmet need? Is there an understanding of what interventions or actions may help address these needs?</li> <li>A discussion of how biomedical or behavioral research can further Tribal health and wellness. What are the current gaps in Tribal health research and opportunities for improving health in AI/AN communities?&nbsp; What are some of the barriers or challenges in closing these gaps?&nbsp; How would addressing them reduce mortality, improve quality of life, or otherwise positively affect Tribal communities? &nbsp;The video must convey the research question of interest as part of a holistic picture of Tribal health or AI/AN communities.</li> </ul>\n<p>Contestants must include a link to a public or unlisted video on YouTube.com, Vimeo.com, or other internet accessible site.

The MPN is a voluntary, openly available resource designed to help health technology developers who collect digital health data clearly convey information about their privacy and security policies to their users. Similar to a nutrition facts label, the MPN provides a snapshot of a product&rsquo;s existing privacy practices, encouraging transparency and helping consumers make informed choices when selecting products. The MPN does not mandate specific policies or substitute for more comprehensive or detailed privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://bit.ly/privacysnapshotinfowebinar\">Watch the recording</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2jYWok1\">download the slides</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;the informational and Q&amp;A webinar on Thursday, January 12</strong></p>\n<p>In 2011, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) collaborated with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and released a Model Privacy Notice focused on personal health records (PHRs), which were the emerging technology at the time (<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn#2011phr\">view&nbsp;2011 PHR MPN</a>). The project&rsquo;s goals were to increase consumers&rsquo; awareness of companies&rsquo; PHR data practices and empower consumers by providing them with an easy way to compare the data practices of two or more PHR companies. In the last five years, the health information technology market has changed significantly and there is now a larger variety of products such as mobile applications and wearable devices that collect digital health data.</p>\n<p>ONC recognized a need to update the MPN to make it applicable to a broad range of consumer health technologies beyond PHRs. More and more individuals are obtaining access to their electronic health information and using consumer health technology to manage this information. As retail products that collect digital health data directly from consumers are used, such as exercise trackers, it is increasingly important for consumers to be aware of companies&rsquo; privacy and security policies and information sharing practices. Health technology developers can use the MPN to easily enter their information practices and produce a notice to allow consumers to quickly learn and understand privacy policies, compare company policies, and make informed decisions. Many consumer health technologies are offered by organizations that are not subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy and security standards. This is detailed in the HHS report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/non-covered_entities_report_june_17_2016.pdf\">Examining Oversight of the Privacy &amp; Security of Health Data Collected by Entities Not Regulated by HIPAA</a>, released in July 2016 by ONC&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Privacy Officer with the cooperation of the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the FTC.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge&nbsp;leverages updated content developed recently by ONC, with feedback from OCR, FTC, and other private and public stakeholders. The content also underwent informal consumer testing. The Privacy Policy Snapshot Challenge provides an award to the creators of the best MPN generator that produces a customizable MPN for health technology developers. The Challenge is a call for designers, developers, and health data privacy experts to create an online MPN generator that is easy for health technology developers to use in customizing a privacy notice that is compelling and understandable to consumers. Submissions will provide the code for an open source, web-based tool that allows health technology developers who collect digital health data to generate a customized privacy notice. The MPN generator must be able to produce privacy notices that adhere to the MPN content yet provide for customization by a health technology developer.&nbsp;Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf\">https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/2016_model_privacy_notice.pdf</a>&nbsp;to download the MPN.&nbsp;You can find more information about the development of the 2016 MPN&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/model-privacy-notice-mpn\">ONC's MPN page</a>.</p>\n<p>The code for the web-based generator must be posted to GitHub and be available through the open source&nbsp;<a href=\"http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/\">MIT License 1.0</a>&nbsp;such that any app developer can implement and use it. The solution should be developed as an HTML webpage styled using CSS (or SASS)&nbsp;that is powered by a framework, library, or plugin developed in JavaScript that is packaged and made available as one of the following:</p>\n<ul> <li>JQuery Plugin</li> <li>Node.JS Module</li> <li>Standalone Script</li> </ul>\n<p>The final output of a successful submission is an MPN generator that can create customized privacy notices that would be accessible from an app or other consumer health technology; the privacy notices must, following the MPN, inform and educate the app or technology user so that they understand how the app or technology uses their personal health data. What the privacy notices created by the MPN generator look like and how they educate the user is up to the submitter &ndash; for example, the notices can be interactive or use graphics and images; however, it cannot be a simple static document such as a pdf. The MPN generator should create privacy notices that factor in accessibility, clean web design, and the differences between reading and understanding content on paper versus online, for which resources like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/\">Health Literacy Online</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://standards.usa.gov/getting-started/\">Draft U.S. Web Design Standards</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usability.gov/\">Usability.gov&nbsp;</a>can be helpful. Submitters are also required to undertake consumer testing of the final customizable MPN produced by the MPN generator, which is intended to help bring in direct user feedback. Testing can be formal (such as standardized assessments or focus groups) or informal (such as among family members or individuals in a waiting room).</p>\n<p>Submitters must provide evidence of testing with at least five people. A larger amount of time spent with each tester, greater formal rigor, and the number and diversity of people used for testing will result in a more positive assessment under the selection criteria. Evidence demonstrating consumer testing could include sample feedback, quotes, or pictures, and should include how it affected development of the language, design, and/or structure of the customizable MPN. Resources like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/\">https://methods.18f.gov/discover/stakeholder-and-user-interviews/</a>&nbsp;can help.</p>\n",

Available water storage, over time, decreases as sediment deposition occurs, thus decreasing the capacity for storage. &nbsp;This sediment deposition, known as sedimentation, also adversely affects reservoir infrastructure operation and maintenance such as outlet works and water intakes. Assessing the loss of storage capacity currently is an expensive and time consuming process performed directly by in-field surveys. The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, is seeking a cost effective method to indirectly estimate the storage capacity and/or sediment volume (storage loss) in reservoirs.</p>\n<p>More info:</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/docs/Sediment_Briefing_Paper_20Sep2016_REVISED.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Download Briefing Paper</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/images/SedimentPoster.PNG\">Download Poster</a></li> <li>Visit Reclamation's <a href=\"https://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/waterstorage.html\" target=\"_blank&quot;\">Estimating Water Storage</a> webpage</li> </ul>\n",

            "description": "<p><strong>Challenge Summary:</strong>\n<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/WFSC-graphic-hashtag.png\" />\nFederal, state, local, and tribal agencies are interested in new ways to monitor air quality during fire events to better protect public health. Air quality managers and public health officials have limited access to accurate information on ground-level air pollution levels in the vicinity of wildland fires, making it difficult to provide appropriate strategies to minimize smoke exposure. Most air pollution monitoring equipment is large, not easily transportable, and complex to operate. Today, emerging technologies – including miniaturized direct-reading sensors, compact/powerful microprocessors, and wireless data communications – offer the opportunity to develop new systems to quickly gather and communicate air pollution data.\nWild fires are increasingly common events that produce significant air pollution, posing health risks to first responders, residents in nearby areas, and downwind communities. Also, wild fires are increasing in frequency and intensity, and the fire season is growing longer.  Prescribed fires, which are used to manage ecosystems or reduce risk of wild fires, are typically managed to minimize downwind impacts on populated areas; however, people in close proximity may still be exposed to smoke.  The description “wildland fires” refers to both wild and prescribed fires.\nThis challenge seeks a field-ready prototype system capable of measuring constituents of smoke, including particulates, carbon monoxide, ozone, and carbon dioxide, over the wide range of levels expected during wildland fires. The prototype system should be accurate, light-weight, easy to operate, and capable of wireless data transmission, so that first responders and nearby communities have access to timely information about local air quality conditions during wildland fire events.</p>\n",

In addition, the self-reported nature of responses particularly in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep has been a major limitation in these surveillance systems, since self-reported data are subject to under/over reporting and recall bias. Meanwhile, the advent of new technologies and data sources including wearable devices ( such as:&nbsp; smart watches, activity trackers, sleep monitors, etc.), mobile health applications on smartphones or tablets, and data from social media represents an opportunity to enhance the ability to monitor health-related information and potentially adjust for methodological limitations in traditional self-reported data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Healthy Behavior Data (HBD) Challenge will be conducted concurrently with a similar challenge proposed by the Public Health Agency of Canada.&nbsp; This will enable the two countries to learn from their respective challenges and leverage information.&nbsp; We expect increased efficiency with a dual challenge.</p>\n<p>The Healthy Behavior Data Challenge participants will propose data sources and approaches for aggregating data from wearable devices, mobile applications and/or social media in the areas of nutrition, physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and/or sleep. In Phase II (Prototype Implementation), a subset of submissions (up to 3) with promising concepts will be invited to test their proposed approaches for ongoing public health surveillance.</p>\n",
            "prizes": "<p><strong>Winner:</strong> Catherine Bass</p>\n<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Onlife Health - Closing the Loop</p>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> Augmenting Mobile Data Sources for Public Health Surveillance The system was designed to simplify and improve the quality and quantity of health behavior data collection by aggregating personal wearable device and mobile health app data, augmented by user validation and supplemented with survey responses. The mobile app was designed to collect and validate data from wearable devices and mobile apps and to collect survey responses on healthy behaviors. The data collected include nutrition, sleep, physical activity and sedentary behaviors. The project included a series of short, just-in-time survey questions delivered via push notification to supplement mobile data sources. The system cross-validated the collected healthy behavior data from the mobile and survey data sets, as well as with the BRFSS survey data. Robert Furberg - RTI International - Enhancing Public Health Surveillance Indicators using Wearable Devices The method was designed to augment any mode of data collection, from interviewer-administered in-person or telephone surveys to self-administration online or via mobile device, with minimal disruption to these essential data collection activities. The project demonstrated how the combination of self-generated data can enhance public health surveillance indicators to provide valid, measures of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and sleep. The approach implemented a three-step data collection:&nbsp; screening, survey, and data retrieval. Owners of Fitbit devices were invited to participate in the HBDC. A service called Fitabase was used for data retrieval of the three measures.</p>\n",

School meal applications have slowed to a trickle and your office is switching gears to draw your verification sample. You have high hopes that the plan you spent so much time refining over the summer will increase your household response rate:&nbsp; a re-designed verification selection notice, text message reminders, and that brilliant idea that Wanda came up with! Surely one of those will make a difference...  You would feel just a little more confident if you knew that another school district had success with a similar strategy.</em></p> <hr /> <p><strong>Background</strong></p> <p>School districts approved almost five million household applications for free or reduced price school meal benefits last year. Nearly nine million children from low income families were named on those applications. You know how vital the school meal programs are to the families in your district. But you also recognize the importance of the annual verification process.</p> <p>Many school districts struggle with low verification response rates. Despite their best efforts some districts get barely half of their households to respond. For other districts a 50 percent response rate would be a big improvement.</p> <p>But just as many districts have identified low-cost and creative strategies, often through trial and error, that allow them to consistently exceed 70, 80, or 90 percent response rates. In some cases those strategies are tailored to unique local circumstances and may not be practical anywhere else. But other strategies are more universal – sometimes a great idea is just a great idea.</p>    <hr /> <p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p> <p>The “Verification Response Rate Challenge” is a public forum for school district officials to exchange ideas on how to increase household response in the annual verification process. District staff can share their own verification success stories or they can build on others’ submissions with constructive feedback and suggestions. Either way, the goal is to encourage dialog, refine ideas, and put great strategies to work.</p> <p>Your contribution may help other school districts increase their verification response rates, reduce the time and expense associated with repeat follow-up reminders to households, and reduce the risk that eligible children lose access to program benefits.</p> <p>The challenge is structured as a contest to maximize engagement and help uncover the most effective solutions. A panel of distinguished judges will review participant submissions on criteria that include proven success, cost effectiveness, practicality, and creativity. USDA will feature submissions recognized in several categories at this summer’s School Nutrition Association Annual National Conference in Atlanta. </p> </div>\n",

            "description": "<h4 id=\"background\">Background</h4>\n\n<p>Manufacturing is important for America’s prosperity. It is estimated that for every dollar spent in U.S. manufacturing, another $1.89 is added to the economy; the highest multiplier effect of any economic sector. Manufacturing accounts for millions of jobs and about 12% of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product. With all that economic activity, the industrial sector accounted for about one-third of total U.S. energy consumption in 20173. Making smart energy investments will enhance our nation’s security, productivity, and energy independence. For manufacturers, every dollar saved allows for investment in production, facilities, and jobs that ultimately makes U.S. companies more competitive and resilient. Improving the energy performance of manufacturing facilities has a broad impact; savings from reduced operating expenses can be reinvested in technology upgrades and new jobs.</p>\n\n<p>Finding ways to cut costs through energy savings seems like an obvious strategy; however, many times these opportunities go unrealized due to competing demands for capital, plant personnel, lack of information, or lack of attention/prioritization. Nevertheless, all across America, manufacturers are showing real leadership, stepping up as champions of energy savings and sustainability. The success of these efforts do not happen without strong leadership from individuals working in the manufacturing facilities, who step up to recognize and implement energy saving opportunities, and who find innovative approaches to push through barriers they encounter along the way.</p>\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Individuals Taking Energy Action in Manufacturing (ITEAM) Prize competition seeks to identify and attract attention to a wide range of ideas and practices that are driving measureable energy savings at U.S. manufacturing plants to stimulate innovation at other facilities. To do so, DOE is launching the ITEAM Prize competition as a means to:</p>\n\n<p>(1) Find individuals who were responsible for creative, specific, and innovative ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at their manufacturing facilities; and</p>\n\n<p>(2) Encourage those individuals to widely share their ideas and practices for the benefit of U.S. Manufacturing facilities nationwide.</p>\n\n<p>Through the ITEAM Prize competition, DOE is seeking the ideas and best practices from employees on the plant floor all around the country who not only recognize the importance of saving energy but are making it happen, strengthening their company’s competitiveness and driving cost savings in the process. By sharing successful strategies and examples of leadership, more manufacturers can drive energy productivity improvements and accelerate the adoption of energy efficient technologies.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"qa\">Q&amp;A</h4>\n\n<p><strong>1. The application deadline is 6 months from now. Is there any advantage to submitting an application now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Can I nominate the leader of our team, that was just recognized for a Better Project Award?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Recognition for a Better Project Award does not impact eligibility under the ITEAM Prize competition. DOE does not make eligibility determinations prior to receiving a complete submission. Participants should view the prize rules and assess whether their submission meets the eligibility requirements.</p>\n\n<p>Individuals may submit an entry on their own behalf. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Can we submit multiple applications (i.e. individuals from multiple facilities)?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Can the cash prize be given to our company foundation instead of the individual?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Individuals may submit an entry on their own behalf. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility.</p>\n\n<p>Applicants will have the option to decline the cash prize if selected and still be recognized as a winner and participate in the events and activities described above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. This information states that plant floor people, but the qualifications do not get very specific. What about staff engineering people? An example would be a lighting engineer who leads and guides all facilities discussion related to lighting efficiency improvements at all plants.</strong></p>\n\n<p>The competition is open to individual employees taking energy action at the manufacturing facility where they are employed. The rules do not restrict the job positions/titles of the participants. DOE will also accept an entry from a U.S. manufacturing facility that identifies an individual employee taking energy action at its manufacturing facility. However the prize itself will only be issued to the individual responsible for the winning ideas and practices that led to significant, measurable energy savings at the manufacturing facility, and not to the manufacturing facility.

This challenge is unique because the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to fund the “would be” startup Founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g. small business grants).</p> <p>NIDA, one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the “2017:&nbsp; $100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the basis for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA hopes that participation in the contest will enable scientists to test the hypothesis that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually any newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and provide mentorship support from NIDA entrepreneurship experts. </strong>The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p> <p><strong>CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION</strong> </p> <p>NIDA is excited to build upon the success of the 2016 Challenge “<a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/100000-for-start-a-sud-startup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup</a>” and is reissuing it in 2017. The challenge is a competition for biomedical scientists with the goal to support research ideas that would further an understanding of neurobiology as it relates to SUD and that are intended to be the basis for the development of a new and potentially successful start-up. NIDA hopes that participation in the contest will enable scientists to test whether their research ideas can be fostered into a biotech startup. The 2017 \"$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and provide mentorship support from NIDA entrepreneurship experts.</p> <p>What does it take to participate in the challenge? The team or an individual must have a research idea that could further the understanding of SUD and is intended to be the basis of the development of a new and potentially successful startup. The research “idea” is the product that your future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products, aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to an underserved customer. The Founder (the teams or an individual) must demonstrate through the Submission the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty.</p> <p>The winners of this challenge are encouraged to use the prize funds to develop a minimum viable proof (MVP) as quickly as possible and to obtain customer feedback to discover if MVP meets the customer needs. If the product prototype is successfully validated, winners are encouraged to create or further advance their biotech startup no later than 6 months after the prize is awarded. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.</p> <p>The research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications consistent with SUD or be specific for prevention and treatments of SUD. For example, if your idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to progress faster and with greater fidelity, entering this challenge is appropriate.</p> <p>The judging of the Challenge is now completed. Based upon the Challenge criteria, the judging panel has selected 10 submissions for the Challenge awards:</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> University of California, Los Angeles (Keith Heinzerling, Dustin DeYoung, Marisa Briones)<br /><strong>Submission Title:</strong> Medication Development for Substance Use Disorders</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> OPAT (Alex Rich, John Cronin, Jarrod Parker, Cameron Yick)<br />    <strong>Submission Title:</strong> Opioid Prescribing Awareness Tool</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> Cornell Engineering World Health (group of multidisciplinary students leading by Nadine Farhat, Michael Solomentsev, Joanna Davis, Ben Edwards, and Jacob Mathai)<br />    <strong>Submission Title:</strong> Drug Usage App - Sensory Monitoring</p> <p><strong>Team:</strong> Pillsy Inc.

The ultimate goal is to achieve science-based stewardship of local water resources. This project proposes that two sensors be deployed, one each at the top and bottom of the Lower Galena River subwatershed to gather continuous data on nitrate levels in this portion of the Galena River. The League has been building relationships throughout the area for over six years and those relationships will provide valuable avenues for communicating the results of the data obtained through continuous nitrate monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;These data will be used as a basis for shifting landowners to best management practices designed to reduce nutrient pollution.&nbsp;</p> </div>\n<p><strong>Development of a Real-time, Continuous Nutrient Monitoring Network for Western Lake Erie to Address Management of HABs and Hypoxia&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Team Lead:&nbsp; Thomas Johengen, Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR), University of Michigan&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Since the 1990s, Lake Erie has been experiencing increased water quality impairment, primarily in the form of extensive toxic cyanobacterial blooms.&nbsp; To combat the growing impacts on the ecosystem health and services of these tremendous natural resources, the Governments of Canada and the United States developed revised binational phosphorus reduction targets for Lake Erie with a goal of 40% lower loading rates then established under the 2012 Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA).&nbsp;To determine progress toward meeting nutrient reduction targets and verifying the response in the lake, active surveillance of nutrients in the lake is essential. Phosphorus concentrations in Lake Erie are highly variable in time and space, making it difficult to determine long-term trends. Deployment of continuous monitoring sensors to provide nearly continuous data will be a critical component of successful nutrient management.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>High Frequency Nitrogen Sensors in Portland, Maine</strong> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>Team Lead:&nbsp; Curtis C.

The Conowingo Dam, which is located in the lower Susquehanna River - the Bay's largest source of nutrients and freshwater - is decreasingly effective at holding back silt from entering the Upper Chesapeake Bay. As a result, additional nutrients associated with those silts are entering Chesapeake Bay and nutrient and sediment reduction strategies are being developed to address the increased nutrient load. The impact of these \"new\" nutrient inputs to Chesapeake Bay, however, remains poorly understood. This project would place two sensors in the Upper Chesapeake Bay and provide much data on how the nutrient load changes over time and in response to storm events. This can help validate models and give insight into the effect these nutrients will have on phytoplankton production and associated oxygen depletion in the estuary.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantifying the impact of dam removals on nitrate retention using low cost nitrate sensors</strong></p>\n<p>Team Lead:&nbsp; Dr.Wilfred Wollheim, Department of Natural Resources and Environment, University of New Hampshire</p>\n<p>Current understanding of how reservoirs affect nitrogen moving through river systems is based on a small number of studies in larger reservoirs. These studies also looked at annual estimates rather than evaluating how nutrient retention varied through&nbsp;time. Dams and their reservoirs are increasingly being removed from the landscape, often because they are aging and would need costly repairs, have no significant utility and/or to improve anadromous fish passage and connectivity with spawning areas. Because reservoirs created by dams are potentially effective at removing nitrogen, such dam removals come with tradeoffs, including reduced nitrate removal. We propose to deploy sensors upstream and downstream of several reservoirs in coastal New England to quantify nitrate removal across seasons and storm events. We will&nbsp;also take advantage of ongoing dam removals and management activities to quantify the nitrogen removal by reservoirs.</p>\n",

USDA NIFA will partner with the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) to provide entrepreneurship training to USDA NIFA grantees under this I-FAST pilot program. The goals are to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from NIFA supported academic research. Selected USDA NIFA I-FAST project teams will have the opportunity to concurrently participate in the educational programs with NSF I-Corps awardees. Over a period of six months the USDA NIFA supported teams in the I-FAST program will learn what it will take to achieve an economic impact with their particular innovation. The final goal of the I-FAST Competition is to facilitate technology transfer of innovations that can make an impact in the marketplace and the global economy.</p> <p><strong>Subject of the Challenge Competition:</strong></p> <p>The USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) mission is to invest in and advance agricultural research, education, and extension to solve societal challenges.</p> <p>As part of this mission NIFA is charged with providing grant funding for research, education, and extension that address key problems of national, regional, and multi-state importance in sustaining all components of agriculture. A majority of NIFA grant funding is provided to academic institutions to focus on developing research in the areas of farm efficiency and profitability, ranching, renewable energy, forestry (both urban and agroforestry), aquaculture, rural communities and entrepreneurship, human nutrition, food safety, biotechnology, and conventional breeding.</p> <p>USDA NIFA will partner with the NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) who will provide an Entrepreneurial Immersion course and training to USDA NIFA grantees through this I-FAST Competition. The goals of this Competition are to spur translation of fundamental research to the market place, to encourage collaboration between academia and industry, and to train NIFA-funded faculty, students and other researchers to understand innovation and entrepreneurship.</p> <p>The purpose of the I-FAST Competition is to identify NIFA-funded research teams who will receive additional support, in the form of mentoring, training, and funding to accelerate the translation of knowledge derived from fundamental research into emerging products and services that can attract subsequent third-party funding. NIFA-funded research teams will be required to participate in Entrepreneurial Immersion courses provided by the NSF I-Corps program. Each team that receives an I-FAST award is required to participate in the following NSF I-CORP activities:</p> <ol> <li>Attendance by the entire team at an on-site three-day NSF I-CORP Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li> <li>Mandatory participation in the I-CORPs weekly Webinars following the in-person three day on-site meeting;</li> <li>Completion of approximately 15 hours of preparation per week over the duration of the program;</li> <li>Attendance of a two-day lessons-learned in-person meeting at the end of the training. During the training, teams are expected to engage in at least 100 contacts with potential customers and provide a 5-page summary report back to USDA NIFA on the outcome of the training and milestones to be met by the team (i.e., commercialization, market proposition, and lessons learned from the program).</li> </ol> <p>The major focus of I-FAST is for the selected teams (an I-FAST team includes the Principal Investigator (PI), the Entrepreneurial Lead, and the Mentor) to participate in an Entrepreneurial Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program. The NSF I-Corps is a program specifically designed to broaden the impact of select, basic research projects by preparing scientists and engineers to focus beyond the laboratory. Leveraging experience and guidance from established entrepreneurs and a targeted curriculum within the NSF I-Corp program, USDA I-FAST teams will learn to identify valuable product opportunities that can emerge from USDA NIFA supported academic research.

The prior award could range from a modest single-investigator award to a large, distributed center and also includes awards involving students.</p> <p>To be eligible to win a prize under the Competition, Teams:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Shall have registered to participate in the Competition under the rules;</li>    <li>Shall have complied with all the requirements of the Competition rules;</li> <li>May not include a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment; and</li> <li>In the case of a private entity Team member, the member shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States. In the case of an individual Team member, shall be a citizen or permanent resident of the United States.</li> </ul> <p>Makeup of I-FAST Competition Teams:&nbsp; Each Team shall consist of three members:</p> <ul> <li>Entrepreneurial Lead (EL)</li> <li>I-FAST Team Mentor</li> <li>Principal Investigator (PI)</li> </ul> <p>I-FAST teams are made up of individuals from an academic/university institution except for the Mentor who may reside with an outside organization as described below.</p> <p>The Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) could be a postdoctoral scholar, graduate, or other student with relevant knowledge of the technology located at the academic/university institution and a deep commitment to investigate the commercial landscape surrounding the innovation. The EL should also be capable and have the will to support the transition of the technology, should the I-FAST Team’s project demonstrate the potential for commercial viability. The EL will be responsible for:&nbsp; 1) developing the team to include the mentor and PI, 2) leading the development of the pre-application, participating in the I-FAST interviews and developing the full application, if selected, 3) starting and completing all training activities in the Entrepreneurial Immersion course provided by the NSF I-Corps program, 4) communicating and coordinating with team members to achieve the goals of the team, 5) developing and monitoring team activity milestones from the Entrepreneurial Immersion course, 6) ensuring the team milestones are completed on time, and 7) ensuring the team is in communication with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director as needed.</p> <p>The I-FAST Teams Mentor will typically be an experienced or emerging entrepreneur with proximity to the academic/university institution and have experience in transitioning technology out of the academic arena. The Mentor should be selected as a third-party resource, or may be a person that has an established relationship with the team (e.g., Board Member), but cannot be an employee nor directly involved with the technology development. Ideally, the Industry Expert should have prior experience developing and commercializing other products within the broader technology space related to the specific project under development. The EL will need to identify a Mentor that has business expertise in the proposed technology sector and has entrepreneurial experience. A Mentor will be someone with the right “rolodex” of contacts in the technology area of commercialization which are critical for “getting the technology out of the university.” The EL of the team should contact their University Technology Transfer Office for ideas of potential Mentors. The I-FAST Team’s Mentor will be responsible for guiding the team forward using existing entrepreneurial experience and tracking the team’s progress through regular communication with the EL, PI, the NIFA I-FAST competition director, and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, as needed.</p> <p>The PI will have in-depth knowledge of the innovation developed under the earlier USDA NIFA Grant and will be responsible for:&nbsp; 1) coordinating with the university on the transfer of prize funds from NIFA, if the team is selected, 2) tracking of the prize funding for team activities, 3) reporting to NIFA on disbursements and obligations of the prize funding, 4) guiding the EL and Mentor on technical aspects of the innovation, 5) communicating as needed with the NIFA I-FAST Competition Director and the NSF I-Corps Program Director, 6) ensuring the EL meets the required milestones for the NSF I-CORP training, and 7) participating as a team member.  The Principal Investigator who received the earlier NIFA grant for the technology is allowed to participate on the team, but cannot be the Entrepreneurial Lead.</p> <p>During the I-Corps course, each participating team, including all its team members, will be required to:&nbsp; </p> <ul> <li>Attend, in person, an evening reception and 3-day kick-off Entrepreneurial Immersion course;</li> <li>Conduct approximately 100 customer interviews over the 6-week program, and submit interview summary reports. This process of customer discovery “outside the building” is expected to require a minimum of 15 hours per week for at least five weeks;</li> <li>Participate in 5 weekly webinar sessions and submit regular updates to the team’s business model canvas. In addition, it is expected that I-Corps teams will take advantage of instructor office hours; and</li> <li>Attend, in person, the final 2-day course close out/lessons learned session (to be held in the same region as the kick-off course).</li> </ul> <p>If one or more team members cannot meet these requirements, the team should not pursue the program.</p> </div>\n",

In particular, better visualization approaches are needed to improve understanding and communication of current and projected conditions in the basin and the water management actions that affect those conditions. Reclamation and its Collaborators seek innovative, interactive, and user-driven visualizations to improve understanding of past, present, and projected conditions in the CRB and to support analysis and decision making by Reclamation and non-Reclamation users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/docs/DataVis_preview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dowload Full Preview</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.usbr.gov/research/challenge/docs/dataviz_poster.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download Poster</a></p>\n<p><em>Questions about this Challenge?

            "description": "<p>[UPDATED 1/8/2018] We are pleased to announce the winning entries to the GSA Student Design Competition for the New San Francisco Federal Building Plaza. The competition challenged students to activate the existing plaza through program and design interventions. The jury evaluated 63 entries which met the submission guidelines and deadline requirements. Entries were evaluated against the judging criteria that were published in the competition announcement, which were Creativity, Context, Community, Feasibility, and Value. The more successful entries, including the winning entries, proposed a new program and offered creative new ways of using the plaza in order to activate the public space. While the competition awards three prizes, the jury felt that in light of the high number of excellent submissions, that they would like to recognize a fourth entry with a special honorable mention.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Honorable Mention &ndash; \"San Francisco Federal Plaza Urban Garden,\" Nancy Spaulding</span></strong> The proposal involves an extensive landscape design renovation that features a substantial addition of trees and other plantings suited to the climate. The design features an educational \"teaching garden,\" which might educate children from the childcare center within the building, as well as the general public. The featured planting would produce food for birds, insect pollinators, and humans. The improvements have the potential to attract visitors, including disadvantaged users, to the plaza. The proposal appeals to building occupants and addresses important community issues. Members of the jury imagine that the produce grown in the plaza could be served in the caf&eacute; in farm-to-table style. The proposal infuses the plaza with elements from the natural environment. The design addresses the needs of the site but does not inhibit future uses. The proposed forest engages visually with people in the upper floors of the federal building and adjacent buildings. The jury commends the urban garden proposal for its optimism.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Third Prize &ndash; \"Allegro,\" by Dan Kaiser</span></strong> This entry proposes an intervention that blurs the distinction between art and landscape. The formally aggressive intervention is inspired by sound waves and the existing building's form, combined to create seating and play space that is intended to transform the space at night. The inclusion of relevant case studies was useful to understand the design intent and feasibility of this proposal. The design refines the caf&eacute; building to maintain the original urban design intent of having a strong, well-defined corner, while also addressing the proposed new plaza design. The jury commends the creativity and quality of this visually stimulating proposal, which creates the potential for success whether people occupy the space as intended by the proposal or not.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Second Prize &ndash; \"Terraform,\" by Thomas Backman</span></strong> The entry proposes an ambitious renovation that is unique among the field of entries in that it proposed an entirely new programmatic use for the plaza. The proposed terrace enables occupants and the public to use this new semi-private space in new dramatic ways. The proposal entertains an expanded view of what is possible with the caf&eacute; and suggests the potential that the site may have for more retail and additional dining options to attract people and activate the plaza. The design establishes the plaza as a part of the city of San Francisco, borrowing symbols from the landscape of the city while preserving the national significance of the federal building. The entry acknowledges the layered contexts of the cultural landscape of the city and the rest of the country. The jury commends the proposal for the well-integrated consideration of programming, landscape, and architectural design.</p>\n<p><strong><span>First Prize &ndash; \"Keeping Time,\" by Margaret C. Weighner</span></strong> The entry is rooted in a conceptually strong and engaging proposal with significant potential to activate the plaza, however it is implemented with an even handed approach that is both respectful and complimentary of the existing building design, artwork, and surrounding context. The proposal challenges conventional notions of landscape architecture and urban design with a highly creative and contemporary intervention, communicated through a professional-quality presentation. A \"floating orb,\" traverses the site and beyond in motion reflective of the celestial movement of the moon, reminding visitors of the connection between the site, city, nation, and even the cosmos. The entry succeeds in explaining the general feasibility of the proposal through detailing an aluminum orb structure that would move along suspension cables while being illuminated by a heliostat. Visible at certain times from the busy pedestrian thoroughfares of nearby Market Street and United Nations Plaza, the orb extends the visibility of the plaza beyond the property line, engaging with both building occupants and the public. The entry inspired jury members to observe that the plaza could be further programmed as an art exhibition space for a series of similar conceptual art installations or performances that would be temporary or impermanent, citing MoMA PS1 in New York as a case study. Jurors used the words \"thoughtful,\" \"big-picture,\" and \"conceptually bold,\" to describe this entry, and award it with the first prize in the competition.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>Join us for this exciting UAS (unmanned aerial systems) prize competition using your ingenuity and hardware build expertise to create a concept for a UAS prototype. The result of the <strong>UAS (Unmanned Aerial Systems) Flight and Payload Challenge&nbsp;</strong>will support the public safety community and its stakeholders.</p>\n<p>One of the barriers for UAS used in a public safety realm is payload versus flight time. Vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAS provide many different mission capabilities, but their flight time is limited. The payload capacity, energy source and flight time are linked through design trade-offs that can be optimized for efficiency and flexibility. This challenge is designed to keep the UAS and its payload airborne for the longest time possible to support first responders&rsquo; communication technology on the ground while they conduct their search. The advancement of UAS research will help search and rescue operations support payloads for wireless communications or other life-saving goods to save lives.</p>\n<p>NIST Public Safety Communications Research Program is hosting this 3-stage challenge, with prize awards totaling $432,000 (includes travel, prototype &amp; cash prizes) for the top 10 designs.&nbsp; In addition to the cash prize, finalists will showcase their UAS and flight skills with paid travel to the NIST Robotics Lab and the 2018 PSCR Stakeholder conference, where pilots will demonstrate their prototype, engage in speaking opportunities and network with 500+ attendees. There are no fees or qualifications needed to enter the first stage.&nbsp; The Stage 1 winning ideas will be eligible for remaining stages of the competition.

Contestants will complete a series of live test flights to demonstrate their prototype UAS flight time and payload capabilities. All contestants UAS will be tested and evaluated. Contestants completing at least the minimum standards will be ranked and, based on those rankings, will receive up to $120,000 in award prizes. First place:&nbsp; $50,000, Second place:&nbsp; $40,000, and Third place:&nbsp; $30,000. In addition, up to $4,000 in invitational travel funding for each team of contestants or contestant entering the contest to demonstrate their work at the PSCR Annual Stakeholders Meeting in June 2018 Only those contestants who successfully complete the Prototyping, Hardware Build and The Prototyping, Hardware Build and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest are eligible to compete in this contest.</p>\n<h2>Important Dates:</h2>\n<p><strong><u>Link to Program Schedule 1</u></strong></p>\n<h2>How to Enter:</h2>\n<ul> <li>Contestants completing the Prototyping, Hardware Build and Video Test &amp; Evaluation Contest should be prepared to complete a similar series of preflight, inflight and safe operation tests on day one of the Live Test &amp; Evaluation Contest. All contestants will be required to complete these safety checks prior to any contest flights.</li> <li>All operators or pilots must be 107 FAA certified or under the supervision of a certified pilot who is a member of the contestant&rsquo;s team.</li> <li>Contestants will be assigned a flight time to demonstrate their prototype UAS capabilities to a panel of judges in real-time and without interruption for the duration of a series of contest flights with different payloads:&nbsp; <ul> <li>10 lbs.</li> <li>15 lbs.</li> <li>20 lbs.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Contest flights will be conducted in an outdoor environment. Each contestant will be assigned a flight area to complete their preflight safety checks and full test flight. Each flight area will be bordered by a safety zone. The UAS will need to achieve an altitude of 50 feet above the surface, navigate to an assigned position, maintain a constant stationary position for the maximum time it is capable of flying, and then safely land.</li> <li>After all of the contest flights, the Judges will convene and discuss each of the contestants&rsquo; performance and give their final scores in accordance with the review criteria.</li> </ul>\n<h2>Evaluation Criteria and Judging:</h2>\n<p>NIST will review each contestant entry in the Live Test &amp; Evaluation Contest. A submission that fails to meet the compliance criteria will be disqualified and will be ineligible to compete in this contest. Submissions that pass the initial compliance review will be evaluated and scored by a panel of judges. An evaluation of a submission by a panel of judges does not constitute the NIST&rsquo;s final determination of contestant or submission eligibility. Submissions will be judged according to the criteria below:</p>\n<h3>Criteria:&nbsp; UAS Safety review (full Compliance required:&nbsp; Pass/Fail)</h3>\n<p>Review the contestants&rsquo; prototype UAS, to ensure it is compliant with the safety features required and that contestants are properly completing pre-flight safety checks, and completing safety inflight tests.</p>\n<h3>Criteria:&nbsp; Position Stability &amp; Landing Accuracy</h3>\n<p>Once the contestants have completed all preflight safety checks, they will be assigned a test flight area. To begin the test flight, the contestant will complete a vertical takeoff from the vertical takeoff and landing location, navigate to an assigned location and hover in place. The hover location will be 50ft above the ground, and the UAV must maintain a location within a three-dimensional space (5 ft. variance on the x, y, z axis) for as long as safely possible. Once the UAV has achieved its maximum flight time, it must safely land to complete the flight. The contestant will navigate the UAV back to the same location as the vertical take off and safely land. The distance between the actual UAV landing location and the vertical takeoff and landing location will be measured to determine landing accuracy.</p>\n<h3>Criteria:&nbsp; UAS Flight &amp; Payload review</h3>\n<p>Review the contestants&rsquo; prototype UAS, to award points based on performance for flight and payload:</p>\n<table> <tbody> <tr> <td width=\"208\">Payload</td> <td width=\"208\">Time</td> <td width=\"208\">Multiplication Factor</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"208\">10 lbs.</td> <td width=\"208\">1 point per minute</td> <td width=\"208\">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"208\">15 lbs.</td> <td width=\"208\">1 point per minute</td> <td width=\"208\">3</td> </tr> <tr> <td width=\"208\">20 lbs.</td> <td width=\"208\">1 point per minute</td> <td width=\"208\">6</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<p>&nbsp; Contestant scores will be calculated as:&nbsp; score = time x factor. Each contestant will receive a score for each contest flight and the total score will be calculated based on the cumulative score from all three (3) contest flights. Contestants with a minimum of 270 points are eligible for prizes. Those contestants exceeding the minimum will be ranked based on their performance for prizes, including safety compliance, landing accuracy, and position stability.</p>\n<h2>Judges</h2>\n<p>The submissions will be judged by a qualified panel of expert(s) selected by the Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology at its sole discretion. The panel consists of Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology and non- Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology experts and will judge the submissions according to the judging criteria identified above in order to select winners.

Many robots are not able to quickly detect failures, or recover from those failures. They aren't able to sense changes in their environment and modify their actions accordingly. Programming these robots for even the simplest tasks takes time and effort.

The goal of the competition was to test the agility of industrial robot systems, with the goal of enabling industrial robots on the shop floors to be more productive, more autonomous, and to require less time from shop floor workers. For the second year of the competition, we are introducing a cash prize to motivate and expand participation. In this context, agility is defined broadly to address:</p>\n<ul> <li>Failure identification and recovery, where robots can detect failures in a manufacturing process and automatically recover from those failures</li> <li>Automated planning, to minimize (or eliminate) the up-front robot programming time when a new task is introduced</li> <li>Fixtureless environment, where robots can sense the environment and perform tasks on parts that are not in predefined locations</li> </ul>\n<p>The competition Participants are required to develop a robot control system (software) to control a robot in a simulated environment. Gazebo (gazebosim.com), which is an open source robotics simulation environment, will be used as the testing platform and the Robot Operating Systems (ROS), which is an open source set of software libraries and tools, will be used to define the interfaces to the simulation system.</p>\n<p>Software interfaces will be made publicly available that will allow the Participants to control the robot.&nbsp; There will be two qualifiers in the April 2018 timeframe with the final competition occurring in mid-May 2018. The competition will be performed virtually in the cloud, so physical attendance is not required to compete. NIST is proposing a workshop to a major robotics conference to allow the winning Participants to present their approaches; details, when available, will be posted to the official challenge website.</p>\n<p><strong>Dates of the Competition:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>Qualifiers Begin:&nbsp; March 5, 2018</li> <li>Qualifiers End:&nbsp; April 13, 2018</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Begins:&nbsp; May 11, 2018</li> <li>Competition Testing Period Ends:&nbsp; 5:00 PM, EDT (UTC-10:00), May 17, 2018</li> <li>Announcement of Cash Prize Winners:&nbsp; May 18, 2018</li> </ul>\n<p><strong>Event Website:&nbsp; </strong></p>\n<p>The Official Rules are posted at <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ARIAC/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ARIAC/</a>.</p>\n<p>The Event Website is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nist.gov/ariac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.nist.gov/ariac</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Prize Amounts:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li>1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;place - $10,000</li> <li>2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;place - $5,000</li> <li>3<sup>rd</sup>&nbsp;place - $2,500</li> </ul>\n<p>Up to three winners will be selected. The Prize Purse for the ARIAC Prize Competition is a total of $17,500. In addition, each winner may be able to select any one representative from their team to present their results at a robotics conference in 2018 in a workshop dedicated to the ARIAC competition. NIST may be able to provide travel funds subject to availability.&nbsp; The number of winners will be fewer than three if there are fewer than three Participants that qualify for the competition. The Prize Purse may increase, but will not decrease. Any increases in the Prize Purse will be posted on the Event Website. NIST reserves the right to announce additional winners of non-cash prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules for being eligible to participate in the Competition:</strong></p>\n<p>Participation in the ARIAC Prize Competition is open to ALL; however, not all participants are eligible to win cash prizes as explained in the next section.</p>\n<p>Each Competition Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register on the ARIAC website. There shall be one Official Representative for each Competition Participant. The Official Representative must provide a name, username (which may serve as a team or affiliation name), email address, and affirm that he/she has read and consents to be governed by the Competition Rules. Multiple registrations per Participant are NOT allowed. At NIST's discretion, any violation of this rule will be grounds for disqualification from the Competition. Multiple individuals and/or legal entities may collaborate as a team to submit a single entry (Participant&rsquo;s code submission to a qualifier or final), in which case the designated Official Representative will be responsible for meeting all entry and evaluation requirements. Participation is subject to all U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations. Participants must not be suspended, debarred, or otherwise excluded from doing business with the Federal Government. Individuals entering on behalf of or representing a company, institution or other legal entity are responsible for confirming that their entry does not violate any policies of that company, institution or legal entity. Any other individuals or legal entities involved with the design, production, execution, distribution or evaluation of ARIAC are not eligible to participate.</p>\n<p>Once registered, Participants will have access to the interfaces needed to participate in the competition through the ARIAC website. NIST will create an account to allow the Participants to upload their submissions to the qualifiers. Modifications and improvements to a Participant's control system during the qualifying period are to be expected, but the Participant should have one final control system ready for the final competition.</p>\n<p><strong>Rules for being eligible to win a Cash Prize:</strong></p>\n<p>To be eligible for a cash prize:</p>\n<ul> <li>A Participant (whether an individual, team, or legal entity) must have registered to participate and complied with all of the requirements under section 3719 of title 15, United States Code as contained herein.</li> <li>At the time of Entry, the Official Representative (individual or team lead, in the case of a group project) must be age 18 or older and a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States or its territories.</li> <li>In the case of a private entity, the business shall be incorporated in and maintain a primary place of business in the United States or its territories.</li> <li>Participants may not be a Federal entity or Federal employee acting within the scope of their employment.

Non-NIST Federal employees acting in their personal capacities should consult with their respective agency ethics officials to determine whether their participation in this Competition is permissible.</li> <li>A Participant shall not be deemed ineligible because the Participant consulted with Federal employees or used Federal facilities in preparing its submission to the ARIAC Prize Competition if the Federal employees and facilities are made available to all Participants on an equitable basis.</li> </ul>\n<p>In addition, interested Participants who do not meet the eligibility requirements to win a prize (i.e., individuals who are neither a US citizen nor a permanent resident of the United States or non-US-based entities) are encouraged to participate in the Competition. They are invited to register on the ARIAC website and download the training material. The performance obtained by these Participants will be displayed on the ARIAC website in the same manner as the performance obtained by Participants who are eligible to win cash prizes.</p>\n<p><strong>How to Participate in the Competition:</strong></p>\n<p>An interested Participant (individual, team, or legal entity) must initiate the process of participating in the Competition by registering at the ARIAC website. The party is then given access to view the documentation and download the tutorials (which provides instructions on how to run the simulations) from the ARIAC website. In the event NIST determines modifications to the documentation and tutorials are needed, all website registrants will be notified by email.</p>\n<p>Once registered, the Participants are eligible to participate in the qualifiers. There will be two qualifiers, both occurring in the April 2018 timeframe (specific deadlines will be published at the official challenge website and all Participants notified by email). Participants only have to complete one of the two qualifiers to be eligible to compete in the final competition. A minimum score will be determined, based on the metrics described below, which Participants have to meet or exceed in the qualifiers to be eligible for the final competition.</p>\n<p>During ARIAC Qualifiers/Finals, each team will submit their system so that it can be run in the automated evaluation setup. This is to ensure that teams are not using prohibited interfaces to interact with the simulation.&nbsp;They will have two work weeks from the date that each qualifier is released on the website (available to be downloaded) to submit their software control system that addresses the challenges in the qualifier. Registered participants will be emailed when the qualifier is released. The&nbsp;following files should be uploaded to an account (<a href=\"http://nfiles.nist.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nfiles.nist.gov</a>) that NIST will set up specifically for each Participant. To allow the ARIAC Competition controllers to automatically run each team's system, teams are required to submit the following files:</p>\n<ul> <li><em>team_config.yaml</em>:&nbsp; The team's sensor configuration file. One sensor configuration is used for all trials.</li> <li><em>build_team_system.bash</em>:&nbsp; A bash script that, when invoked from the command-line on a clean Ubuntu system, will install the necessary dependencies and build the team's code.</li> <li><em>run_team_system.bash</em>:&nbsp; A bash script that, when invoked from the command-line on a system that has had <em>build_team_system.bash&nbsp;</em>run, will start the team's system and begin interacting with the ARIAC competition trial.</li> </ul>\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>build_team_system.bash</em>&nbsp;script will be run only once to setup the team's system, and the&nbsp;<em>run_team_system.bash</em>&nbsp;script will be run one time for each of the scenarios to be tested against.</p>\n<p><strong>Competition Scenarios</strong></p>\n<p>The following terminology is frequently used in this document</p>\n<ul> <li>Order:&nbsp; A list of products and their goal location in a box.</li> <li>Product:&nbsp; One element of an order.</li> <li>Box:&nbsp; A container that holds the products.</li> <li>Fulfilled Order:&nbsp; A box and set of products that make up an order.</li> </ul>\n<p>ARIAC requires Participants to complete a series of tests centered in an industrial scenario that is based around order fulfillment. The robot system will work within the environment specified in the Work Environment section. Challenges will be introduced in each scenario. Scenarios may include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul> <li>Baseline Order Fulfillment - The task for this scenario is to pick specific products and place them in a box. The robot arm will receive an <em>Order</em> that details the list of products and their target locations.</li> <li>Dropped Product - One or more products will drop from the robot's gripper. The robot will need to recover after dropping a product and complete the given Order. Recovery could entail picking up the dropped product, or fetching a new product.</li> <li>In-Process Order Change<strong> - </strong>While the robot is in the middle of fulfilling an order, a new high priority order will be received that needs to be completed as fast as possible. The robot will need to decide how best to complete this new order, and then complete the previous order.</li> </ul>\n<p>The competition will consist of 15 trials:&nbsp; Each trial will receive a score based on completion and efficiency metrics outlined in the Scoring section.</p>\n<p><em><u>Environment</u></em></p>\n<p>The simulation environment is a representation of an industrial order fulfillment work cell with a robot arm, product bins, and boxes.</p>\n<p>There are multiple product bins that may be used for order fulfillment. Products in these bins will not be replaced once used. There is a robot arm mounted on a linear actuator. The linear actuator measures <strong>4 m</strong>.</p>\n<p>An automated guided vehicle (AGV) and/or drone is located at the end of the linear actuator. Orders are fulfilled at the AGV/drone. A Participant will programmatically signal the AGV/drone when the fulfilled orders are ready to be taken away. The signaled AGV/drone will depart with the box.</p>\n<p>Boxes measuring <strong>0.5 x 0.7 m</strong>. are used for order fulfillment.</p>\n<p><em><u>Robot Arm</u></em></p>\n<p>The robot arm's position is controlled through the linear actuator on which it is mounted. The end of the arm is equipped with a vacuum gripper.</p>\n<p>The vacuum gripper is controlled in a binary manner and reports whether or not it is successfully gripping an object.</p>\n<p><em><u>Sensors</u></em></p>\n<p>A Participant can choose which sensors to use around the environment. Each sensor has a cost that factors into the final score.</p>\n<p>A sample of available sensors may include:</p>\n<ol> <li>Break beam:&nbsp; reports when a beam is broken by an object. It does not provide distance information.</li> <li>Laser scanner:&nbsp; provides an array of distances to a sensed object.</li> <li>Cognex logical camera:&nbsp; provides information about the pose and type of all models within its field of view.</li> <li>Proximity:&nbsp; detects the range to an object.</li> </ol>\n<p><em><u>Order</u></em></p>\n<p>An order is an instruction containing products for the robot system to place in the box. Each order will specify the products to be gathered.</p>\n<p><em><u>Faulty products</u></em></p>\n<p>Above the belt at a key location is a quality control sensor that detects faulty products. If faulty products are detected while Participants are filling boxes, those products should be removed from the box and replaced with another product of the same type.</p>\n<p>Faulty products are considered unwanted products:&nbsp; they will not count for any points when the order is fulfilled, and they will cost Participants the all-products bonus if left in the boxes (see Scoring, below).</p>\n<p><strong>Competition Process</strong></p>\n<p>Each trial will consist of the following steps:</p>\n<ol> <li>The robot programmatically signals that it is able to begin accepting orders.</li> <li>The first Order (Order 1) is sent to the robot.</li> <li>A fixed amount of time is allowed to complete the order.</li> <li>In the case of the Dropped Product testing method, up to three products will be forcibly dropped from the gripper.</li> <li>In the case of the In-Process Order Change testing method, a new Order (Order 2) will be issued that is of higher priority than the previously issued Order 1. When Order 2 is complete, building of Order 1 is to resume.</li> <li>The robot signals programmatically when an order is ready for delivery.</li> <li>The robot system will be notified that the trial is over. The trial is over when time runs out or all Orders have been fulfilled.</li> </ol>\n<p><strong>Judging Panel </strong></p>\n<p>The NIST Director will appoint a panel of three qualified judges. The Judges will be robot agility and/or simulation experts from inside and/or outside of NIST. The Judges will determine winners according to the Judging Criteria described herein. The Judges may not have personal or financial interests in, or be an employee, officer, director, or agent of, any entity that is a registered Participant in the Competition and may not have a familial or financial relationship with an individual who is a registered Participant. In the event of such a conflict, a Judge must recuse himself or herself and a new Judge may be appointed.</p>\n<p><strong>Basis on which Finalists and Winners will be selected</strong></p>\n<p>A portion of the scores will be automatically calculated, shared with the Participants, and publicly posted for each Trial at the conclusion of the Finals (after all Trials are run) as a combination of cost and performance metrics, described below in the Trial Score Calculation section. A Participant's final automated score is the sum of scores for each of the 15 competition Trials.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost Metrics</strong> The following values are calculated for a Participant&rsquo;s system setup. As Participants are to use the same system setup for all Trials, the values will remain unchanged between Trials. The choices made by the competitors (choices of sensors) will have a specific cost associated with them. The costs are:</p>\n<ol> <li style=\"list-style-type:none;\"> <ol> <li>$500 for each logical camera used.</li> <li>$200 for each depth camera used.</li> <li>$100 for each other sensor used (e.g., break beam, proximity, laser scanner).</li> </ol> </li> </ol>\n<p>The sum of these cost choices made by each team will be divided by a baseline cost of $1700 and made into a cost factor for the scoring. The team costs are designated as <em>TC</em>, and the baseline cost is designated as B<em>C</em>.&nbsp; The cost factor, is then calculated as:</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/cost-metrics.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Completion Score</strong></p>\n<p>Performance metrics that cover both completion and efficiency are calculated for each Trial separately. Completion captures the quality of the orders fulfilled (that the boxes contain the correct products in the correct position/orientations); efficiency captures the responsiveness in fulfilling orders (that the orders were filled quickly).</p>\n<p>Each trial, since it has the option to have more than one order, will have a certain set of scores for each order. Each order consists of a list of products needed and a prescribed position and orientation for each product within the shipping box. The completion score, <em>CS</em>, is a combined score for each order, starting with 1 point for each product that is placed in the shipping box. For each product that is within 3 cm of the correct position, and within 0.1 radians of the correct orientation will result in an additional point. Next, since the main focus of the competition is to have fulfilled orders, any order with all of the products in the confines of the shipping box and in the correct position/orientation receives an additional point for each product. So, for an order s_<em>j</em>&nbsp;with <em>i</em> products in it would have a maximum score of:</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/completion-score.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Efficiency Factor</strong></p>\n<p>The Efficiency of the approaches chosen by the teams are accounted for in the scoring by using the times that each team takes to complete each trial. The times are counted in seconds from the start of the trial until the first order is completed and is designated as <em>T_01</em>. In the trials with multiple orders, the time, <em>Tj</em> is counted in seconds from the time that the <em>j</em>th order is sent to the team. For each trial, an average of the times for each team (<em>ATj</em>) is compared to the individual team time to calculate the Efficiency Factor:</p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/efficiency-factor.png\" /></p>\n<p>If a team&rsquo;s system times out for a trial, the efficiency factor for the trial is set to 0 and the trial time is not used to calculate the average times for that trial.</p>\n<p>For the multi-order trials where one of the orders is a high priority order, an additional multiplier, <em>h</em>, is applied with the efficiency factor to give a higher proportion of the score to that order, which is initially set to a value of 3. The final <em>h</em> value will be made available to the Participants at least two weeks before the finals.</p>\n<p><strong>Trial Score Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>All of the scoring factors described above are combined as shown below to calculate the score for each trial:&nbsp; </p>\n<p><img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/challenge-content/trial-score-calculation.png\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Final Score Calculation</strong></p>\n<p>The final overall score is the equally weighted sum of all trial scores. As mentioned in the Competition Scenarios section, trials are expected to focus on the Baseline Order Fulfillment, Dropped Products, and In-Process Order Change scenarios, among others.</p>\n<p><strong>Winners:</strong>&nbsp;The Winners of cash prizes will be determined by three Judges appointed by the NIST Director, using the Judging Criteria outlined herein.</p>\n<p><em>Judging Criteria:</em></p>\n<ol> <li><strong>Overall Performance based on the scoring metrics described above (80 points)</strong> <ol> <li>Using the scoring metrics described herein, the first place Entry will be award 80 points, the second place Entry will be award 70 points, the third place Entry will be awarded 60 points, and so on.</li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Novelty of approach and alignment with spirit of competition (20 points)</strong> <ol> <li>At the judges&rsquo; sole discretion, up to 20 points will be awarded for Entries that show novel approaches to solving the agility challenges and whose approaches are consistent with the spirit of the competition of coming up with industrially-implementable approaches that will help industry make better use of their robotic platforms.

How can we do this if we don&rsquo;t even have models for the basic processes such as welding, drilling, and forging? Sewing, assembly, or distillation? Nope, we don&rsquo;t even have models for those either! At least, not the types of models really needed for our high-tech world. Manufacturers need models to improve operations, to protect the environment, to share information, and to compose them into systems. Using your models will let manufacturers simulate, improve, and optimize all sorts of processes. Showcase your manufacturing research by entering the RAMP 2018 Challenge!&nbsp; Finalists will be invited to present their entries in a workshop at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.asme.org/events/msec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">co-located ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC) 2018 and the 46th NAMRI/SME North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)</a> in College Station, TX, on June 18-22.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Click on the \"Rules\" link on the left of the page to check out the official rules for details on eligibility and submission criteria.</strong><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-165880 size-medium\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/challenge-gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/welder_with_torch_1600_clr_6058-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><strong>Theme:</strong> This year's RAMP competition will be underlined by the theme...</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><span><strong>T</strong><strong>racking Resources and Flows through the System</strong></span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Similar to <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/ramp-reusable-abstractions-of-manufacturing-processes-2017/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">last year's competition</a>, the building blocks of each submission are&nbsp;the Unit Manufacturing Process (UMP) models, which represent Reusable Abstractions of Manufacturing Processes (RAMP).

            "description": "<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), announces the launch of the Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge.</p>\n<p>Million Hearts&reg;&nbsp;is a national initiative to prevent one million heart attacks and strokes by 2022. Achieving this goal means 10 million more Americans must have their blood pressure under control. Million Hearts&reg; is working to control high blood pressure through clinical approaches, such as using health information technology to its fullest potential and integrating team-based approaches to health care, and community approaches, such as strengthening tobacco control and promoting physical activity.</p>\n<p>To support improved blood pressure control, HHS/CDC is announcing the 2018 Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Control Challenge. This competition identifies practices, clinicians, and health systems that have worked with their patients to achieve hypertension control rates at or above 80% through innovations in health information technology and electronic health records, patient communication, and health care team approaches. The application will be scored based on the hypertension control rate for your most recent 12-month reporting period ending not earlier than December 31, 2017; and the degree to which the patient populations' characteristics present significant challenges in attaining hypertension control (up to 5% score). Applicants with the highest score will be required to participate in a two-phase process to verify their data. Applicants who are non-compliant or non-responsive with the data requests or timelines will be removed from further consideration.</p>\n<p>Phase 1 includes verification of the hypertension prevalence and blood pressure control rate data submitted and a background check. For applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, phase 2 consists of a medical chart review. In addition, background checks will be conducted by an independent source for individual or small practice applicants to ensure there are no serious sanctions or that other misconduct has occurred (as outlined in the Eligibility section). For large providers or health systems, their background check policy and implementation will be reviewed for compliance with the individual background check protocol. In addition, a health system background check will include a search for The Joint Commission's sanctions and current investigations for serious institutional misconduct (e.g., investigations for professional medical misconduct).</p>\n<p>Phase 2 of the validation, for applicants whose Phase 1 data is verified as accurate, consists of hypertension control validation via medical chart review. Applicants must provide documents showing the criteria used to include patients as \"controlled\" and a list with each hypertensive patient found to have blood pressure in control. Thirty patient records will be selected randomly for file review for compliance. For the thirty records selected, electronic copies of all of the pertinent medical records will be submitted through a secure FTP site with a secure login.</p>\n",

            "how-to-enter": "<p>To enter the Challenge, participants must complete the application form online. The application form is a combination of short answer responses, checkbox responses, and assurances. Application information includes:</p>\n<ol> <li>The size of the applicant's adult patient population defined as the number of adult patients served during the reporting year regardless of diagnosis, a summary of known patient demographics (e.g., age distribution), and any noteworthy patient population characteristics. The reporting year (12-months) should reflect the most currently available data with an end date no earlier than December 31, 2017.</li> <li>The percent of the applicant's adult patient population identified above that were seen during the reporting year and had a hypertension diagnosis (i.e., hypertension prevalence). There are an estimated 11 million people who are unaware of their hypertension. Most of these people are hiding in plain sight&mdash;they are in clinical treatment with elevated blood pressure documented, but hypertension is neither diagnosed nor treated. Applicants selected as finalists will have their reported hypertension prevalence (i.e., percentage of their practice or system population with the condition) assessed for alignment with their predicted hypertension prevalence. Initially, a rough estimate of the applicant's predicted hypertension prevalence will be calculated using the reported age distribution of their patient population and hypertension prevalence findings from national studies, using the Million Hearts&reg; Hypertension Prevalence Estimator Tool. If the applicant's reported prevalence varies considerably from this rough estimate, the applicant may be asked to describe possible reasons for this disparity during the data validation process. If the reported hypertension prevalence is extreme and there is not a justifiable reason, the applicant may be excluded from further participation in the Challenge.</li> <li>The hypertension control rate should be for the provider's or health system's entire adult hypertensive patient population, ages 18-85, not limited to a sample. The provider's or health system's hypertensive population age 18-85 should include only patients in primary care or in cardiology care in the case of a cardiology clinic. Patients seen only in dental care or behavioral health care should not be included. Examples of ineligible data submissions include hypertension control rates that are limited to treatment cohorts from research studies or pilot studies, patients limited to a specific age range (such as 18-35), or patients enrolled in limited scale quality improvement projects.</li> <li>The applicant's current hypertension control rate among their hypertensive population identified above during the reporting year. In addition, the hypertension control rate during the previous reporting year is also required. If the current reporting year is January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, then the previous reporting year is January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016.</li> <li>In determining the hypertension control rate, CDC defines \"hypertension control\" as a blood pressure reading &lt; 140 mmHg systolic and &lt; 90 mmHg diastolic among adult hypertensive patients ages 18-85.</li> <li>A description of clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control. Completion of a checklist of sustainable clinic systems or processes that support hypertension control. These may include provider or patient incentives, dashboards, staffing characteristics, electronic record keeping systems, reminder or alert systems, clinician reporting, service modifications, etc. Checkbox responses may be supplemented by a short answer response. Supporting information about clinic systems is encouraged but not required.</li> <li>The applicant must agree to:&nbsp; <ol> <li>Participate in a data validation process (described below), accept the award if selected, and participate in award activities.</li> <li>Complete, without revisions, the CDC contractor's required HIPAA compliance Business Associate Agreement form and/or other forms that may be required by applicable law.</li> <li>Participate in a 1 to 2 hour interview or similar activity to gather information about their hypertension control strategies, and work with CDC on the review of material to share clinical strategies. Strategies used by Champions that support hypertension control may be written into a success story, placed on this website, and attributed to Champions.</li> <li>Assume any and all risks and waive claims against the federal government and its related entities except in the case of willful misconduct, for any injury, death, damage, or loss of property, revenue or profits, whether direct, indirect or consequences, arising from participation in this prize contest, whether the injury, death, damage or loss arises through negligence or otherwise.</li> <li>Indemnify the federal government against third party claims for damages arising from or related to competition activities.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>\n<p>Applicants not agreeing to each of these items on the application form will be excluded from the Challenge. Paper responses will not be accepted. The estimated burden for completing the application form is 30 minutes.</p>\n"

The purpose of this series of competitions is to provide a platform for researchers to&nbsp;develop more advanced differentially private methods that can substantially improve the privacy protection and utility of the resulting datasets.</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Databases across the country include information with potentially important research implications and uses, e.g. contingency planning in disaster scenarios, identifying safety risks in aviation, assist in tracking contagious diseases, identifying patterns of violence in local communities. &nbsp;However, included in these datasets are personally identifiable information (PII) and it is not enough to simply remove PII from these datasets.&nbsp; It is well known that using auxiliary and possibly completely unrelated datasets, in combination with records in the dataset, can correspond to uniquely identifiable individuals (known as a linkage attack).&nbsp; Today's efforts to remove&nbsp;PII do not provide adequate protection against linkage attacks. With the advent of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; and technological advances in linking data, there are far too many other possible data sources related to each of us that can lead to our identity being uncovered.</p>\n<h2>Get Involved - How to Participate</h2>\n<p>The Unlinkable Data Challenge is a multi-stage Challenge.&nbsp; This first stage of the Challenge is intended to source detailed concepts for new approaches, inform the final design in the two subsequent stages, and provide recommendations for matching stage 1 competitors into teams for subsequent stages.&nbsp; Teams will predict and justify where their algorithm fails with respect to the utility-privacy frontier curve. In this stage, competitors are asked to propose how to de-identify a dataset using less than the available privacy budget, while also maintaining the dataset&rsquo;s utility for analysis.&nbsp; For example, the de-identified data, when put through the same analysis pipeline as the original dataset, produces comparable results (i.e. similar coefficients in a linear regression model, or a classifier that produces similar predictions on sub-samples of the data). This stage of the Challenge seeks <u>Conceptual</u> Solutions that describe how to use and/or combine methods in differential privacy to mitigate privacy loss when publicly releasing datasets in a variety of industries such as public safety, law enforcement, healthcare/biomedical research, education, and finance. &nbsp;We are limiting the scope to addressing research questions and methodologies that require regression, classification, and clustering analysis on datasets that contain numerical, geo-spatial, and categorical data. To compete in this stage, we are asking that you propose a new algorithm utilizing existing or new randomized mechanisms with a justification of how this will optimize privacy and utility across different analysis types.&nbsp; We are also asking you to propose a dataset that you believe would make a good use case for your proposed algorithm, and provide a means of comparing your algorithm and other algorithms.</p>\n<p><strong>All submissions must be made using the submission form provided on <a href=\"https://www.herox.com/UnlinkableDataChallenge\">HeroX website</a>.&nbsp; Submissions will be judged using the listed criteria and scoring scheme.&nbsp;Challenge Sponsor has the right to make updates and/or make any changes at any time during the Challenge.

The Challenge serves as a platform to capture the imaginations of technology and data firms, transportation stakeholders, and state and local agencies to unlock their creativity, and empower them to develop innovative new data visualization tools that can help improve road and rail user safety, to benefit all transportation users. The Challenge is open to individuals and teams (Solvers) from the business and research communities, including technology companies, analytics firms, transportation carriers, industry associations, research institutions, universities, mapping and visualization providers. Solvers will compete for cash prizes that will be awarded throughout the multi-stage Challenge. The Challenge prize purse is $350,000, with four semi-finalists competing for a portion of the $100,000 interim prize and two final-stage Solvers competing for a portion of the $250,000 final prize. The Challenge will begin on June 14, 2018. After the launch, USDOT will accept Stage I submissions up to 11:59 pm EDT on July 31, 2018. A panel of judges will review team submissions and announce Stage I finalists in August 2018.</p>\n<p><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><u><a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2018-06-14/pdf/2018-12795.pdf\">Solving for Safety Solver Solicitation</a></u></li> </ul>\n<p><strong>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>For more information, and to register your intent to compete individually or as part of a team, visit&nbsp;<u><a href=\"http://www.transportation.gov/Solve4Safety\">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a></u></p>\n<p><strong>PROBLEM</strong></p>\n<p>In 2017, motor vehicle traffic crashes resulted in an estimated&nbsp;<u><a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542\">37,150 fatalities</a></u>. Comprehensively, crashes are a societal harm that cost the Nation&nbsp;<u><a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812451\">over $800 billion annually</a></u>&nbsp;in lives lost or injured, as well as lost work productivity and property damage. When the cost of serious crashes is put into context, the weight of this issue becomes much more grave and the need for an innovative, non-traditional approach becomes apparent. Safety is USDOT&rsquo;s number one priority, and we are committed to reducing the incidence of serious and fatal injuries on our roadways.<a name=\"_ftn1\"></a>&nbsp;The USDOT&rsquo;s transportation safety programs have decades of research and design behind them and have proven effective in reducing injuries and fatalities by 40% between 1990 and 2011.&nbsp; In recent years, these advances have leveled off, and new insights and strategies are required to make further advances. Traditional factors do not fully explain the causes of the recent significant increase in traffic fatalities. Increases in driving are one factor; however, the rate of fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) also increased from 1.08 fatalities per 100 million VMT in 2014 to an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812542\">estimated 1.17 in 2017</a>.&nbsp;Economic conditions, gasoline prices, weather and other factors are also correlated with increased traffic fatalities. USDOT seeks to reverse the current trend, rapidly detect changes that indicate unsafe conditions, and reduce transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries across the transportation system.&nbsp; The Department is pursuing data-informed decision-making to help strategically prioritize and address transportation safety risks.&nbsp; One pillar of this approach is data visualization.&nbsp; USDOT seeks clear, compelling data visualization tools that make data analysis and insights accessible to policy-makers, transportation providers and the public who make safety choices every day.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></p>\n<p>Currently transportation decision makers have a limited number of analytical visualization tools available that reveal insights, and even fewer focused on safety and prevention of serious crashes.&nbsp; A new opportunity lies in the rapid growth and advancement in technology and analytics markets combined with the volume and variety of transportation and other data now collected by the public and private sectors. For this reason, Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge is looking for the best innovators from the business and research communities, including technology companies, analytics firms, transportation carriers, industry associations, research institutions, universities, mapping and visualization providers, to tackle this challenge.&nbsp; Analytical visualization tools can cast new light on the data to reveal insights not seen though tabular analysis. The Challenge has been created to advance the use of safety data visualizations for answering analytical questions related to surface transportation system safety. In this challenge, Solvers will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative analytical visualization tools to gain insights into fatalities and serious injuries on the U.S. road and rail systems that policymakers, providers, and operators can use to inform the development of safety solutions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Solvers will choose to develop one of two types of analytical visualization tools:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Discover Insights Tools</strong>&nbsp;which analyze data to reveal patterns and trends, and use compelling visualizations to explain what is happening, understand the meaning behind the data, and draw conclusions. These tools often combine disparate data sets and allow a user to ask a question and search for answers visually.</li> <li><strong>Simulation Tools</strong>&nbsp;which assist in decision-making by visualizing data, mathematical, and statistical models to identify issues, determine correlations, and assign probabilities with a degree of accuracy.&nbsp; Developed using existing models and data, including those provided by USDOT and Innovation Agents, this type of tool will allow users to visualize the outputs of model simulations and scenarios, highlighting the different conditions and the results of sensitivity and parametric analysis to visually assist in decision-making.</li> </ul>\n<p>USDOT is looking for Solvers to bring novel concepts and perspectives to existing models and data to develop analytical visualization tools that provide life-saving insights and solutions for transportation safety.&nbsp; Solvers should use innovation and creativity to further define the tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tools can range from dashboards using disparate data sets, to spatial analysis via maps, virtual or augmented reality scenarios, image and image analysis, social media mining and beyond. The tools can be powered by models and data provided by USDOT, Challenge Innovation Agents and/or resources to which Solvers have access to through their organizations, partners, and other sources. See&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.transportation.gov/solve4safety\">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a>&nbsp;for a sample list of datasets and tools. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge Solvers will develop analytical visualization tools to complement existing USDOT projects while addressing one or more of the following safety focus areas:</strong></p>\n<ol> <li><strong>Vulnerable System Users</strong>&ndash; these include non-motorized road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists, as well as motorcyclists and persons with disabilities or reduced mobility and orientation, such as those with declining vision and hearing.&nbsp; Ongoing work at USDOT has identified those who are more at risk on the road system, but beyond the police reports and behavior research, pieces of the story that can improve how we protect these users are still missing. Example questions Solvers might address:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Between 2013 and 2016 there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812246\">25-percent increase</a>in pedestrians killed in traffic crashes. A disproportionate share of these pedestrian fatalities involved males, occurred in urban locations, and took place after dark. How can data visualization tools support decision-makers in learning from the relationships among various contributory crash risk factors that are specific to their communities?</li> <li>A Crash Modification Factor (CMF) is a multiplicative factor that indicates the proportion of crashes that would be expected after implementing a countermeasure. Examples of countermeasures include installing a traffic signal, increasing the width of road edge lines, and installing a median barrier.&nbsp; We have proven that different countermeasures work, and we know the CMFs for each countermeasure, but how could we help decision makers choose among appropriate countermeasures?</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Conflict Points Impacts</strong>&ndash; these are locations where user paths intersect, including road intersections and rail grade crossings. Conflict points are categorized as crossing, merging (or joining) and diverging (or separating). We&rsquo;re investigating which conflict points correlate most with motor vehicle crashes, but we don&rsquo;t fully understand the difference between near-misses and impacts at these points. Example questions Solvers might address:&nbsp; <ul> <li>Much of the nation is built around the railroad system. By developing around this infrastructure, we have unintentionally created conflict points that users are drawn to, often putting communities at greatest risk. How can data visualization tools better support urban planners identifying which grade crossings are more prone to accidents and the best risk reduction strategies to employ?</li> <li>In the United States, over the last several years an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/intersection/\">average of one-quarter</a>of traffic fatalities and roughly half of all traffic injuries are attributed to intersections. Strategies to address roadway intersection safety are diverse:&nbsp; they are often engineering-based, including geometric design and application of traffic control devices (such as signs, markings and signals) and with a foundation in human factors. Quite often, it is a combination of these strategies that is needed to truly solve a problem. How can we visually compare the safety impacts of traditional signals, roundabouts, and protected left turns?</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>High Risk Factors</strong>&ndash; these include young drivers, impaired drivers, drowsy drivers, older drivers, and speeding drivers. We&rsquo;ve identified high risk factors, but we don&rsquo;t have complete insights on the role of spatial and temporal exposures. Example questions Solvers might address:&nbsp; <ul> <li>There is a misalignment between human behavior and judgment, and roadway and vehicle design. New, young drivers have a higher crash risk than any other age group. How can data visualization tools support and educate people to improve their driving behaviors?</li> <li>In 2015, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 29 percent of the total motor vehicle traffic fatalities. How can data visualization tools support first responders&rsquo; on-site interventions?</li> </ul> </li> </ol>\n<p><strong>Challenge Solvers will also focus their analytical visualization tools by designing them for use by one of the following audiences:</strong></p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Policy makers and influencers</strong>&nbsp;&ndash;these are people in Federal, State, and local government agencies, associations, and industry bodies.&nbsp; They attempt to reduce transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries by analyzing safety data to identify safety risks and recommending a series of strategies, incentives or disincentives using personnel, funding, or laws and regulations to address them.</li> </ul>\n<ul> <li><strong>Providers/Operators</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; these are people in business and government who build and operate the transportation system.&nbsp; These include vehicle and equipment manufacturers, trucking and rail companies, state and local departments of transportation, law enforcement, and emergency services. They attempt to influence the reduction of transportation-related fatalities and serious injuries by analyzing safety data and designing equipment and facilities, performing system diagnostics, evaluating safety effectiveness, and developing operations, countermeasures and techniques to reduce fatalities and serious injuries for users of the transportation system.</li> </ul>\n<ul> <li><strong>Public</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; these are people who use the transportation system or live in the United States.&nbsp; These include motor vehicle drivers, motor vehicle passengers, bicyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; They have an interest in protecting themselves and others in the community who use the transportation system.</li> </ul>\n<p>All ideas will compete against the full pool of entries regardless of the type of tool, safety focus area or audience being proposed. The Challenge invites creative minds from across the Nation to reveal these missing links.&nbsp;The business and research communities have the unique set of skills and creativity to step up and revolutionize transportation safety. The transportation safety community has welcomed innovation, but will benefit further from the perspective and skills of other subject areas. To foster new, novel, and innovative analytical visualization tools, USDOT is looking for Solvers and data from a variety of sectors. The USDOT encourages the participation of Solvers from outside the traditional transportation safety arena who will bring innovative methods, procedures, techniques, and strategies when developing solutions.&nbsp;The USDOT also has an interest in stimulating the integration of new or private sector data sources into the Solvers&rsquo; analytical visualization tools.</p>\n<p><strong>CHALLENGE INNOVATION AGENTS</strong></p>\n<p>Challenge Innovation Agents are companies and organizations interested in providing real-world knowledge, guidance, insight, issues, and data to Solvers, especially those new to the transportation safety space.&nbsp; USDOT will provide a public listing of all organizations and companies who identify as Challenge Innovation Agents.&nbsp; This listing will provide a brief description and contact information for each Innovation Agent to assist Solvers that are interested in talking to or partnering with Innovation Agents for the Challenge.&nbsp;USDOT will list two types of Challenge Innovation Agents:&nbsp; Technical Assistance and Data.</p>\n<ul> <li><strong>Technical Assistance (T.A.) Innovation Agents</strong>&nbsp;can provide interested Solvers with knowledge, guidance, insight and issues related to transportation safety.&nbsp; T.A. Innovation Agents may be able to provide technical assistance related to key safety issues impacting their members or employees, transportation safety techniques, transportation system characteristics, users and operations, approaches from other industries and sectors.</li> <li><strong>Data Innovation Agents</strong>&nbsp;can provide interested Solvers with access to data or analytic techniques that can be used in the analytical visualization tools. Use of a wide variety of disparate data is encouraged to gain insights into reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the U.S. road and rail systems.</li> </ul>\n<p>Challenge Innovation Agents will have the opportunity to explain their expertise and capacity to interested Solvers who will be designing tools that can prove useful in furthering the Innovation Agents or other user&rsquo;s efforts to reduce fatalities and serious injuries.&nbsp; Innovation Agents providing data access will benefit from national recognition and highlight of their data asset, and the exploration and testing of their data by Solvers for use by the transportation safety community. Solvers are encouraged to seek support from Innovation Agents to strengthen their individual/team expertise. Innovation Agents may register their support throughout the Challenge by signing up at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.transportation.gov/solve4safety\">www.transportation.gov/solve4safety</a>. A list of current Innovation Agents will be updated on the official Challenge website. The Challenge will host a webinar to facilitate Solver-Innovation Agent relationship building.</p>\n<p><strong>Technology has already changed how most of us get around. Let&rsquo;s leverage it to change how we view transportation safety.</strong>&nbsp;The USDOT Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge can act as an engine in driving serious crash reduction. By incentivizing innovation, USDOT will attract the best Solvers from around the nation to come up with new tools for visualizing the risks of serious crashes. As with other government competitions, the USDOT Solving for Safety Visualization Challenge aims to create a vibrant community of thinkers and doers who drive revolutionary innovation. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>The Office on Women&rsquo;s Health (OWH) is seeking new ways to get health messages out to women and girls. According to the CDC, two out of every three women in the United States are overweight or obese<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/obesity-overweight.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>1</sup></a>. This extra weight can lead to many diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and many cancers. Obesity results from a combination of causes and contributing factors, including individual factors such as behavior and genetics. Some examples of behaviors that affect weight include diet, physical activity, inactivity, and stress. Improving behaviors in these areas can help women and girls maintain a healthy weight.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, American children today are increasingly unhealthy at earlier ages. According to the 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), of girls ages 2-19, 16 percent were overweight and 17.1 percent were obese<a href=\"https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Many children and teens do not eat properly or exercise enough and as a result, childhood obesity and diabetes are increasingly prevalent. Children with obesity may experience immediate health consequences that can lead to weight-related health problems in adulthood. In addition to physical health problems, overweight and obese children can be targets of social discrimination that can lead to low self-esteem and hinder social and academic functioning.</p>\n<p>Video games are a unique medium to boost knowledge and skills and can lead to behavior change through exploration of cause and effect in a virtual environment. According to a Robert Wood Johnson project called &ldquo;Health Games Research,&rdquo; it was found that digital games can be effective in improving children&rsquo;s health in multiple health topics including physical fitness, health promotion, and disease management<a href=\"http://healthgamesresearch.org/our-publications/research-briefs/Game-Changer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Additional evidence suggests adult learning and behavior change is also possible through gaming. A study in <em>JMIR Serious Games</em> found that women with a higher baseline readiness to change experienced improvement in BMI and nutrition with game play<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.2196/games.4977\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><sup>4</sup></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Your challenge with this competition is to create an interactive video game with focus on obesity prevention or weight control for women or girls. The game you create will be shared with the general public. The game must address an evidence-based obesity prevention or control strategy. You must show that the game is unlike currently available offerings. The game must be made publically available at no cost as either a web-based or mobile based game available on a widely accessible platform.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more information about obesity prevention or control strategies and guidelines view the CDC&rsquo;s resource here:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/strategies-guidelines.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/resources/strategies-guidelines.html</a>.</p>\n<p>The competition has three phases. All eligible submissions will be evaluated and separate prizes will be awarded for each of the three phases.</p>\n<p><strong>Dates:</strong> Submissions will be accepted starting January 31, 2019. The submission period for Phase 1 will end on March 31, 2019. The Phase 2 (In-Person Presentation) submission period will be on a date TBD in 2019. The prize winners will be announced at the completion of each phase.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Entries not in compliance with the submission requirements outlined below will be ineligible for further review and prize award. During the open submission period, participants must submit the following information to enter the Shape of Health competition:</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 1 (Concept Development)&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The first stage of the competition aims to attract a large range of ideas and game developers. The target submission of the first stage will be the conceptualization of the most promising and/or unique game to help support behavior change around physical activity and/or nutrition to prevent obesity in women or girls. The submissions should aim to demonstrate that the proposed game will be accessible to the general public, developed from evidence-based prevention or control techniques, and engaging for women or girls.</p>\n<p>The Phase 1 Submission shall include a comprehensive description of the proposed game in 5 pages or less, including:</p>\n<ol> <li>A one-paragraph executive summary that clearly states how the game will target obesity prevention or control determinants and be developed for a women or girls audience;</li> <li>Link evidence to support the obesity determinant chosen and the theoretical basis for the game (will your game change behavior? improve knowledge? something novel? etc.);</li> <li>A descriptive overview of how the participant arrived at their idea, and why the approach is unlike anything already available;</li> <li>A draft storyboard of the game that describes the game components; and</li> <li>An assessment describing the participant's ability to execute the proposed solution through Phase 2 and to completion.</li> </ol>\n<p>Your Shape of Health competition concept submission must be uploaded on Challenge.gov.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participants may also choose to include additional determinants that contribute to obesity not discussed in the provided resources.&nbsp; If additional determinants are included, the participant should include a short description of how these determinants may contribute to obesity and how this game will addresses these determinants.</p>\n<p>Up to 10 selections will be made in Phase 1 to continue on to Phase 2.</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 2 (In-person Presentation)</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 2 of the competition builds upon the work of Phase 1 and is focused on prototyping the game, and providing an in-person presentation to a panel of judges. The participants should demonstrate both the evidence base for the intervention and its viability.</p>\n<p>The in-person presentation must include a description of how the following components are incorporated into the game:</p>\n<ul> <li>Relates to women or girls;</li> <li>Targets a determinant of obesity; and</li> <li>Engages the player</li> </ul>\n<p>Selected participants must build out the storyboard submitted in Phase 1 to become a visual presentation of game play. The visual presentation of game play must be recorded into a video and available through a private YouTube link. OWH expects that the participants provide an in-person presentation, which includes a demonstration of the recorded presentation of game play.</p>\n<p>Submissions must be free of security threats and/or malware. Participants agree that HHS may conduct testing on the submission to determine whether malware or other security threats may be present. HHS may disqualify the submission if, in HHS&rsquo; judgment, the software may damage government or others&rsquo; equipment or operating environment or if the game, in HHS&rsquo; judgment, is inconsistent with HHS&rsquo; public health mission, utilizes software or other technologies without appropriate licenses, or any other reason deemed necessary.</p>\n<p>The expectation is that each team will use the prize money from Phase 1 for at least one person to travel to Washington, D.C. to deliver the in-person presentation.</p>\n<p>Up to 2 selections will be made in Phase 2 to continue on to Phase 3</p>\n<p><strong>Phase 3 (final development)</strong></p>\n<p>Phase 3 builds upon the work of Phase 2 and is focused on the final development of the proposed game and making it available to the general public. Entrants are required to ensure that proper obesity prevention or control determinants are included in the final game.&nbsp; Participants are encouraged to discuss the proper obesity prevention or control determinants with OWH in order to make sure that they are included in the final game.</p>\n<p><strong>Basis upon Which Winners Will Be Selected:</strong> A panel composed of subject-matter experts will judge eligible Shape of Health competition entries.&nbsp; The panel will make winner selections based upon the criteria outlined below and in compliance with the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/idealab/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/HHS-COMPETITION-JUDGING-GUIDELINES.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HHS Competition Judging Guidelines</a>.</p>\n<p>One winner may be selected from each category (1 women&rsquo;s health and 1 girls&rsquo; health).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
