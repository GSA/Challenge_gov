            "description": "Water managers need more skillful information on weather and climate conditions to help efficiently utilize water resources to reduce the impact of hydrologic variations. Examples of hydrologic variations include the onset of drought or a wet weather extreme. Lacking skillful sub-seasonal information limits water managers’ ability to prepare for shifts in hydrologic regimes and can pose major threats to their ability to manage the valuable resource. \n \nThe challenge of sub-seasonal forecasting encompasses the lead times of 15 to 45 days into the future, which lay between those of weather forecasting (i.e. up to 15 days, where initial ocean and atmospheric conditions matter most) and seasonal to longer-lead climate forecasting (i.e. beyond 45 days, where slowly varying earth system conditions matter most, such as sea surface temperatures, soil moisture, snow pack). \n \nThe Rodeo II Challenge series will create algorithms to enhance sub-seasonal forecasting, reducing risks to our water systems, and helping water managers efficiently manage hydrological variations. \n \nThis challenge series will first have one traditional marathon match challenge to establish predictive algorithms on historical weather data, and then recurring data science challenges (sprints) over the next **full year** to refine those solutions on live weather data. \n \n**Key Dates** \n \n**Pre-Registration:** June 27 to week of July 19, 2019 \n \n**Marathon Match:** Week of July 19th to week of August 18th, 2019 \n \n**Data Science Sprints:** Fall 2019 start to Fall 2020 with recurring sprints every two weeks over the full year. \n \n**Marathon Match Winners:** Anticipate announcement late to early September 2019 \n \n**Data Science Sprint Winners:** Anticipate announcement of winners after each sprint, beginning in late Fall 2019 \n \n**Data Science Full Year Winners:** Anticipate announcement of winners at the end of the full year in late 2020 to possibly early 2021.",

            "description": "<p><strong>Update:</strong> NIDA understands that the emergency declaration related to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) will adversely affect many Challenge applicants' ability to submit applications in a timely manner.</p> <p>Therefore, Challenge applications will be accepted through May 26, 2020. New dates for the judging period and winners announcement are also reflected under \"Dates\" in this section.</p> <h3><strong>Challenge Summary</strong></h3> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Institute on Drug Abuse</a> (NIDA), one of the components of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announces the 5th “$100,000 for Start a SUD Startup” Challenge. The Challenge goal is to support research ideas that would further an understanding of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of successful new startups. NIDA expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup, and that eventually the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p> <p>The Challenge will offer up to ten awards of $10,000 each and technical expertise and mentoring from NIDA scientific research entrepreneurship experts. The Challenge total purse is up to $100,000.</p> <h3><strong>Subject of the Challenge</strong></h3> <p>NIDA is reissuing this Challenge after confirming its dependable success and popularity within the community from 2016 to 2019. The Challenge is a competition for participants with research ideas that would further an understanding of SUD and that are intended to be the foundation for the development of new successful startups. NIDA offers $100,000 together with the technical expertise and mentoring from scientific research entrepreneurship experts and expects that the contest will enable participants to test the premise that their research idea can be fostered into a biotech startup. This Challenge is unique because NIDA intends to provide the prize money and scientific research-based entrepreneurial assistance to the “would be” startup founders much earlier than most investors, incubators, or traditional models of research funding (e.g. small business grants). However, NIDA anticipates that, eventually, the newly created startups will contribute to the pool of innovative small business companies that can successfully compete for NIDA’s Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) funding.</p> <p>What does it take to participate in the Challenge? The participants must have a research idea directly related to SUD or that could be extended or adjusted to be useful for SUD. For a platform technology, the research idea must be broad enough to address multiple conditions, diseases, or indications, including SUD. For example, if the idea can only work for cancer or diabetes, entering this Challenge is not appropriate. However, if the plan is to test an idea for a research tool that would further an understanding of neurobiology or epigenetics relevant to SUD to advance the field faster and with greater fidelity, entering this Challenge is appropriate. The participants must also be interested in creating the startup around their research idea. The research “idea” is the product that the future startup will offer. Here, the term startup “product” is used in its broadest definition. Product is any source of value for the people who become customers. Services, subscriptions, software as a service (SaaS), physical/tangible products (biomedical devices, drugs, etc.), aggregations, etc. could all provide value and thus be considered startup products. The startup product could be the result of novel scientific discoveries, repurposing an existing technology for a new use, extending a research observation or discovery made in a different scientific area into SUD, devising a new business model or distribution/delivery channel that unlocks new value, or simply bringing a product or service to an underserved customer.</p> <p>The potential startup founder must also have the passion, drive, discipline, ability to work collaboratively and willingness to push forward under conditions of extreme business uncertainty.</p> <p>The winners of this Challenge are encouraged and offered training to use the prize money to develop a minimum viable product (MVP), to obtain customer feedback to discover if the MVP meets the customer needs, and to assess the feasibility of science-based small business creation, within 6 months post-award. Post Challenge, as with all other NIH grant applicants, NIDA staff will provide dedicated assistance and guidance about the grant submission process, including how to submit an SBIR/STTR application to NIDA’s small business programs.</p> <h3><strong>Dates</strong></h3> <ul> <li>The Challenge begins January 2, 2020.</li> <li>Submission Period:&nbsp; 9 a.m. ET, January 21, 2020 to May 26, 2020, 5:00 p.m. ET.</li> <li>Judging Period:&nbsp; May 27, 2020 to June 15, 2020.</li> <li>Winners Announced:&nbsp; June 22, 2020.</li> </ul> <h4><strong>For further information, contact:</strong></h4> <p>Elena Koustova, PhD, MBA, Director, Office of Translational Initiatives and Program Innovations (OTIPI), NIDA Challenge Manager, National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), 6001 Executive Blvd Room 4206, MSC 9555 Bethesda, MD 20892-9555.

These represent species and associated trophic levels most frequently tested when evaluating the ecological hazards of chemicals.

            "description": "<p>The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking innovative ways to communicate with others and educate people about rare diseases through social media or art. There are about 7,000 different rare diseases that affect an estimated 30 million people in the United States. Some difficulties with rare diseases are that they are hard to recognize, are often hidden conditions, and most do not currently have ongoing medical research. The goal of this Challenge, which is being led by NCATS&rsquo; Office of Rare Diseases Research (ORDR), is to bring attention to rare diseases so that they can gain more medical research interest, thereby improving the lives of people with rare diseases. Science, especially genetic medicine, has moved forward to the point now where treatments are possible&mdash;such as gene therapies, 3-D printing (devices, tissues, and organs), and new drugs.

            "description": "<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is inviting novel Solutions for the NHLBI Big Data Analysis Challenge:&nbsp; Creating New Paradigms for Heart Failure Research. The goal of the challenge is to foster innovation in computational analysis and machine learning approaches utilizing large-scale NHLBI-funded datasets to identify new paradigms in heart failure research. The challenge aims to address the need for new open source disease models that can define sub-categorizations of adult heart failure to serve as a springboard for new research hypotheses and tool development in areas of heart failure research from basic to clinical settings.</p> <p>Adult heart failure is a chronic, progressive disorder in which the heart is unable to efficiently pump blood, and more than 6.5 million Americans suffer from this condition. It is currently often categorized by a single metric – left ventricular ejection fraction – but is known to be a multi-organ, systemic syndrome with many related but seemingly disparate phenotypes. Additionally, social, behavioral, environmental, and genetic determinants often captured in study data have a considerable influence on outcome but are not well-understood. The field of heart failure research currently lacks a systematic framework that incorporates these many factors in a comprehensive disease model. An adult heart failure sub-phenotyping scheme incorporating many disease-associated factors would provide a new paradigm that will benefit investigations into the mechanism of disease, diagnosis, and, ultimately, prevention and treatment.</p> <p>The NHLBI seeks to foster such paradigm shifts in heart failure research by awarding innovative Solutions that utilize existing large health datasets. NHLBI has a history of making considerable investments in the creation of deep data resources including:&nbsp; long-standing, deeply-phenotyped <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/population-and-epidemiology-studies\" target=\"_blank\">epidemiological cohorts</a>, innovative <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/clinical-trials/nhlbi-clinical-trials\" target=\"_blank\">clinical trials</a>, and large-scale <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/precision-medicine-activities\" target=\"_blank\">precision medicine</a> efforts that have generated whole genome sequencing and “other omics” data for more than one-hundred thousand individuals. Many of these and other data are publicly accessible via the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/\" target=\"_blank\">dbGaP</a>) and the Biologic Specimen and Data Repository Information Coordinating Center (<a href=\"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/home/\" target=\"_blank\">BioLINCC</a>). The NHLBI Heart Failure Big Data Analysis Challenge webpage, <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/HFdatachallenge</a>, provides further details about available open- and controlled-access NHLBI-funded datasets and data access resources.</p> <p>With these datasets in hand, the NHLBI is seeking to promote the application of computational analysis and machine learning approaches to create opportunities for hypothesis generation and research tool development for heart failure research. This challenge aims to reward innovative, computational Solutions utilizing large health datasets to develop a schema for the sub-phenotyping of adult heart failure that facilitates basic and/or clinical heart failure research objectives. A successful adult heart failure sub-phenotyping Solution will be a novel, pragmatic, accessible research tool for a spectrum of heart failure researchers. Successful Solutions will also be free and openly available to the research community. Participants are strongly encouraged to take advantage of NHLBI-funded datasets in the development of their Solution and are also welcome to bring other relevant data to their analyses.</p>",

There will be no external connectivity available during the Challenge. Technologies that require an external/cloud connection will be disqualified.</li> <li>Technologies are expected to provide visibility into their resource usage and computational performance in an easily accessible manner.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Environment</strong></p> <p>The evaluation environment will be the Cybersecurity Operations Research Range (CORR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Submitted technologies must include documentation necessary for installation and configuration, and also an evaluation license that covers minimally the following conditions:</p> <ul> <li>A trial period through December 2020,</li> <li>A maximum 10 Gb/s supported network data rate, and/or</li> <li>Supporting traffic from a network up to 1,500 nodes in size.</li> </ul> <p>The software and/or hardware components for the on-premises console must be one of the following:</p> <ul> <li>Exported Virtual Machine Image (e.g., .ova, .qcow2, etc.) that can be run with a libvirt-compatible hypervisor (e.g. QEMU, XenServer, VMWare, Virtualbox, Emulab, etc.)</li> <li>Docker container package</li> <li><em>Standalone&nbsp;</em>hardware appliance that&nbsp;<strong><em><u>will not</u></em></strong><em> be&nbsp;</em>connected to external cloud services</li> </ul> <p><strong>Challenge Evaluation Process</strong></p> <p>The evaluation process will include four major steps once submissions are received.</p> <ol> <li><strong>White Paper Analysis.</strong> ORNL&rsquo;s team with consultation of NAVWAR will review the submission of white papers to determine eligibility and down select to a subset of the technologies to be evaluated.</li> <li><strong>Technology Installation and Configuration.</strong> For those submissions remaining, the evaluation team will attempt to install and configure each technology in the range environment, in order to assure communication with the range data interfaces and tune each technology&rsquo;s configuration. A maximum two-day on-site support by the submitting organization may be required to optimize the configuration. At the conclusion of the Installation and Configuration stage, the technology configuration will be locked.</li> <li><strong>Training &amp; Tuning:</strong> The generation of ambient data for ML model training will happen once the range configuration is locked. Each technology will be exposed to approximately three weeks of traffic for ML model generation.</li> <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The actual test evaluation process of the tool will involve levying multiple adversarial campaigns against the enterprise, with increasing complexity and realism. Technologies will be evaluated on their ability to detect elements of each campaign as it progresses.

The score will be in terms of a cost estimate that simulates the cost to an enterprise using this technology for a given period of time. The cost estimate will sum simulated attack costs, labor costs, and resource costs.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Simulated attack cost:</strong>&nbsp;Estimated costs resulting from each campaign&rsquo;s malicious events will be a function representing attack costs over time. This simulates costs of lost or corrupted data, ransoms, etc. The attack cost function is increasing in time and in steps of the attack kill chain, such that early detection will accrue less cost than later (or no) detection. Simulated attack cost is only accrued for a true positive (alerting on a malicious event) until time of detection, and for a false negative (no alert on a malicious event) resulting in a maximum attack cost.</li> <li><strong>Simulated security operator cost:</strong>&nbsp;Estimated SOC costs, based on actual labor rates of security operators, will be computed for initial setup and ongoing use of the technology. For each alert issued by the technology, labor costs for triage, investigation, and incident response will be incurred. Ongoing security operator costs are incurred for both true positives (alerting on malicious events), and false positives (alerting on benign events).</li> <li><strong>Simulated</strong> <strong>resource cost:&nbsp;</strong>Estimated resource costs for initial setup and ongoing use of the technology will be based on rates from recent research. Ongoing resources that will be monitored and incorporated may include but are not limited to usage of CPU, volatile memory, disk I/O, network I/O.</li> </ul> <p><strong>THE WINNERS OF THE CHALLENGE WILL BE THE PARTICIPANTS WITH THE LOWEST COMPUTED TOTAL COST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SCORING ABOVE.</strong></p>",

            "description": "<p>At an unprecedented pace, Federal and state leaders, community based organizations, and all avenues of the health care system are expending their time and resources to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. We at ACL recognize the need and are expanding the timeline of this new funding opportunity. The Challenge Competition will now begin in July. As a result of this crises, there is a greater need for enhanced, standardized data tracking and referral processes and an even more need to connect people with the right community resources and supports. This will continue to be a priority as we think about the resources necessary to address the effects of COVID-19.</p> <p><strong>Today&rsquo;s Landscape of Health and Social Care Coordination for Older Adults and People with Disabilities:</strong></p> <p>Individual health plans and health systems are implementing technology approaches to screen and refer individuals to community resources in order to address their social needs and improve their health and overall well-being. However, the existing technology solutions lack interoperability and scalability within and across communities. Since 2003, states and community based organizations<sup>1</sup> (CBOs) have invested in robust resource directory and referral platforms through state <a href=\"https://nwd.acl.gov/\">No Wrong Door (NWD) System</a> integration to streamline access to long term services and supports for older adults, individuals with disabilities, and their caregivers. State NWD Systems include a community based approach to person-centered planning and assessment, information and referral to state and community resources, and a governance structure that ensures these functions are available across the state. However, provider and plan specific referral platforms are often not leveraging this existing infrastructure that enables access to a variety of services and supports that address social needs.</p> <p>While some states have developed or are planning statewide technology platforms that enable social risk assessments and referrals from health care to community resources, there is a need for a more collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach that ensures the interoperability and scalability of such platforms.<sup>2</sup> As is, there is duplicative spending across stakeholders as they independently contract for different referral vendors to secure community connections. As a result, community based organizations are faced with the burden of accessing multiple platforms to receive and act on referrals. Opportunities to manage populations across a continuum of care are also limited when individuals seek care from providers with differing platforms that lack seamless connections to critical health and social care.</p> <p>The need for seamless exchange of referrals is also met with optimizing data on social determinants of health (SDoH) to ensure individuals get timely access to services and supports they need such as housing, nutrition, and transportation. Over the last several years, a variety of community led efforts are developing industry-wide standards to represent these components of SDoH and to enable exchange of person-centered data between health information technology platforms and CBOs.<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; One such effort, perhaps the largest such activity in the SDoH space, is the Gravity Project.<sup>4</sup> The Gravity Project aims to standardize medical codes and exchange standards to facilitate the use of SDoH-related data across a wide range of care management settings between health care and human services providers, and others as authorized and appropriate. There is a need for health plans and systems to require and for technology vendors to uniformly adopt technical standards, which are being developed and tested. This include standards on the format, content and structure of SDoH data, community resource directories, and bi-directional exchange of referral messages.&nbsp; The mid-to-long term goal is consistent implementation of standards for SDoH data, bi-directional exchange of referrals, and resource directories across technology platforms that serve health care and CBOs.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The Administration for Community Living (ACL), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a competition for state and community leaders in the aging and disability network, health care systems, health plans, and health IT vendors to cultivate care coordination by developing and/or optimizing interoperable and scalable technology platforms. Participants are challenged with working collaboratively on enhancing scalable approaches to securely sharing standardized data on social determinants and person-centered plans through the use of open resource directories that seamlessly connect and interoperate with health care system&rsquo;s electronic health records to community based organizations. This Challenge includes developing prototypes and implementing technical solutions that track referral patterns and gaps in service that visibly display social service and health related outcomes overtime.</p> <p>To demonstrate value and achieve seamless network integration, technical solutions are challenged with incorporating closed-loop referral and follow-up protocols to track and support individuals when they obtain services from any organization or health care provider within the network. Producing data on the individual, organizational, and regional levels about referrals, the prevalence of SDoH, and service utilization and outcomes guarantees opportunities to strengthen coordinated referral networks across CBOs, states, and the health care system. Technology-based platforms that enable linkages between healthcare providers and the existing ecosystem of community-based, social service organizations are challenged to more efficiently share standardized data to support referral processes and better informed decision-making, ensuring that individuals are seamlessly connected to resources that address their preferences, goals, values, and social determinants in ways that promote independence in the community for as long as possible.</p> <p>Critical partners for designing solutions to this Challenge should include a team of key stakeholders. Strong preference will be given to teams that include state leaders across aging, disability and Medicaid programs (or their designees), community based organizations in the aging and disability networks, health IT developers, health care providers, health plans, and others with expertise in technical standards, interoperability and data analysis.</p> <p>The Challenge will compete in three phases with cash prizes awarded in each phase. The total prize award available is $500,000. &nbsp;</p> <p>Phase 1:&nbsp; Concept &amp; Design Submission (July &ndash; December 2020)</p> <ul> <li>Form multi-stakeholder team, submit letter of intent and develop idea and concept designs that include data visualization methods and functional enhancements to technology platforms that connect health and social services. <ul> <li><strong><u>Intent to apply:</u></strong> An individual, entity, or captain of a team, with support of all team members, is to provide a brief letter of intent to submit an application for this Challenge. Email letter of intent by August 14, 2020 to <a href=\"mailto:ami.patel@acl.hhs.gov\">ami.patel@acl.hhs.gov</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Phase 2:&nbsp; Proof of Concept &amp; Demonstration (January 2020 &ndash; June 2021)</p> <ul> <li>Participant teams will convene in-person or virtually to demo proposed solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Phase 3:&nbsp; Implementation &amp; Testing - (July &ndash; December 2021)</p> <ul> <li>Implementation and real-world testing of designed approach.</li> </ul> <p><strong><u>What is a Challenge?</u></strong></p> <p>A challenge (also referred to as \"prize challenge,&rdquo; \"competition,\" \"prize competition,\" \"incentive prize\" or any combination thereof) allows the public to solve problems presented by federal agencies and receive awards for the best solutions. This boils down to three steps:</p> <ol> <li>Agency announces a problem to the public.</li> <li>Participants create and submit solutions to the problem.</li> <li>Agency evaluates solutions and awards prizes to the best ones.</li> </ol> <p>This process may sound similar to grants or contracts, but challenges differ in small and significant ways. In grants and contracts an agency receives proposals to do work, chooses one and then pays the monetary award incrementally as the work is done. In challenges, an agency generally selects winner(s) after assessing work that has been completed. In more complex, multi-phase challenges, phase winners may be selected progressively as development stages are completed.</p> <p>Unlike contracts in particular, which provide detailed and comprehensive specifications of the work that needs to be done, challenges define a smaller set of requirements, which allows participants to bring more of their own creativity to solutions.&nbsp; This can be advantageous when a problem can be solved many different ways, including ways that the agency is not even aware of.&nbsp; The open-ended approach can entice participation from those who may not have direct expertise in the problem subject matter area but can lend expertise from their diverse backgrounds.</p> <p>Challenges can serve multiple goals beyond sourcing solutions to problems, including:</p> <ul> <li>Signal interest in an area that you think markets should be doing more to serve</li> <li>Reach wide communities of experts</li> <li>Deliver messages to the public in a fun, interactive way</li> <li>Generate interest in new services, data or technologies your agency provides</li> <li>Develop public buy-in for agency initiatives</li> </ul> <p>For more information, please visit:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/\">https://www.challenge.gov/toolkit/faq/</a></p> <hr /> <p>[1] Community Based Organizations may include Area Agencies on Aging, Aging and Disability Resources Centers, Centers for Independent Living or other aging and disability network agencies.</p> <p>[2] Examples of statewide approaches include:&nbsp; 1) Oregon Health Leadership Council, HIT Commons, <a href=\"http://www.orhealthleadershipcouncil.org/hit-commons/\">http://www.orhealthleadershipcouncil.org/hit-commons/</a>, 2) Pennsylvania Request for Information for Statewide Resource and Referral Tool, <a href=\"http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=Resource%20and%20Referral%20Tool\">http://www.emarketplace.state.pa.us/Solicitations.aspx?SID=Resource%20and%20Referral%20Tool</a></p> <p>[3] &ldquo;Advancing Interoperable Social Determinants of Health Data,&rdquo; HealthITBuzz blog post, December 12, 2019, <a href=\"https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/advancing-interoperable-social-determinants-of-health-data\">https://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/interoperability/advancing-interoperable-social-determinants-of-health-data</a></p> <p>[4] HL7 International, &ldquo;The Gravity Project&rdquo;, <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/gravity/\">https://www.hl7.org/gravity/</a></p>",

One disease must be sickle cell, malaria, and / or anemia. Proposals will only be accepted if they describe a way to extend to two diseases on a single platform. Full points require in vivo target accuracy in representative background populations for two diseases, though scoring will be scaled appropriately.</li> <li><strong>Analytic performance. </strong>Proposed device must be relevant for clinical decision-making, with results that are comparable to or improve upon standard practice at a peripheral care setting. The device must have comparable analytic sensitivity and specificity to existing tests. The device should be able to incorporate dynamic personal and population priors (e.g. medical history or disease prevalence, respectively) to improve the accuracy of the test result in clinical settings.</li> <ul> <li>For anemia, in comparison to the reference method, 85% of the results must fall within +1.0g Hb/dL of the reference across a range of Hb concentrations spanning the healthy range and moderate to severe anemia.</li> </ul> <li><strong>Clinical utility. </strong>Device must be able to differentiate between relevant strains of the disease, across necessary population age brackets, and over the course of disease progression.</li> <ul> <li>For <strong>sickle cell</strong>, the device needs to differentiate sickle cell as early in life as possible, in conjunction with dynamic priors. Ideally, the device should be able to perform with high levels of fetal hemoglobin still present and should be able to differentiate sickle cell disease from sickle cell trait.</li> <li>For <strong>malaria</strong>, the device needs to be able to detect and differentiate various parasite species. Required are Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and / or Plasmodium vivax (Pv); Optimal is all Plasmodium species. If all species cannot be differentiated, differentiation between Pf  and Pv is desired.</li> <li>An <strong>anemia</strong> diagnostic must clinically differentiate mild, moderate and severe anemia.

            "description": "To improve service to and communication with stakeholders and the general public, the Department of Education (“ED” or “Department”) plans to modernize its public facing website.  Accordingly, ED is seeking interactive prototypes for a redesign of ED.gov, the Department’s homepage.  \n \nThe Department is not seeking a run-of-the-mill refresh but rather a creative redesign that maximizes user experience and proposes new innovations in layout, typography, animation, illustration, video and photography, and other modern advances. \n \n#### **NEW! [Submission Form](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/challenge-appl.pdf>) and [Frequently Asked Questions](<{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/redesign-faqs.pdf>)** \n \n*About the Department of Education* \n \nED is the agency of the federal government that establishes policy for, administers, and coordinates most federal assistance to education. The Department assists the president in executing his education policies for the nation and in implementing laws enacted by Congress. ED's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. \n \nAlthough ED is a relative newcomer among Cabinet-level agencies, its origins go back to 1867, when President Andrew Johnson signed legislation creating the first Department of Education. Its main purpose was to collect information and statistics about the nation's schools. However, due to concern that ED would exercise too much control over local schools, the new Department was demoted to an Office of Education in 1868. \n \nOver the years, the office remained relatively small, operating under different titles and housed in various agencies, including the U.S. Department of the Interior and the former U.S. Department of Health Education and Welfare (now Health and Human Services). \n \n*The Current State of ED.gov* \n \nTo achieve its goals and further its mission, ED maintains open communication with the general public, especially those seeking information on behalf of their states, districts, schools, and children. That’s why the organization must keep pace with the way 21st century Americans learn, engage, and interact. With 312 million internet users in the United States alone – and 90 percent of American adults reporting using the internet “[at least occasionally](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276445/number-of-internet-users-in-the-united-states/)”  – it is essential to maintain a strong web presence. A key component of that effort is redesigning ED’s website. \n \nED.gov is the Department’s main public-facing website, with nearly 15 million users accessing the site in 2019. These users represented:  students and parents; press; educators and administrators; state and local officials; non-profit stakeholders; representatives from community organizations; and advocates, among others. The site’s most-visited pages included information about student loan and grant programs, and laws – like the Freedom of Information Act and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. \n \nThe Department’s web presence includes several subdomains: www.ED.gov, www2.ed.gov, blog.ed.gov, and sites.ed.gov. ED.gov is managed with the open-source Drupal, WordPress and TeamSite content management systems (CMS) and is hosted externally in a cloud environment. \n \n*Limitations and Challenges of Current Design* \n \nNearly 40 percent of people will stop engaging with a website if the design is [unattractive](https://blogs.adobe.com/creative/files/2015/12/Adobe-State-of-Content-Report.pdf), and nearly half of users cite design as the number one factor in assessing [credibility](https://www.bluecorona.com/blog/20-web-design-facts-small-business-owners/). Design plays a critical role in ensuring the public has access to, and engages with, the content on ED.gov. \n \nThe last large-scale update of ED.gov occurred in 2015. At that time, ED analyzed available data to determine what pages most users were accessing and redesigned the homepage to fit the public’s evolving needs. This redesign reduced the number of homepage links and created more open space, so the page became more easily navigable to the end user. The update also meant that the entire flagship site offered a mobile-friendly experience, with all content layouts using responsive design. \n \nWhile the update included several important changes, the design fell short in key areas. Customers find it challenging to quickly locate information that meets their needs. The current site: \n \n* Remains difficult to navigate; \n* Does not incorporate the latest functionality that enhances the user experience; \n* Relies too heavily on text; \n* Is antiquated; and \n* Does not have a consistent brand, look, or feel. \n \n*Goals for a Redesigned ED.gov* \n \nThe goal for this Challenge is to improve the overall quality of the design, navigation, interactivity, and presentation of ED.gov.  \n \n**The challenge is for design prototypes only.** The design prototypes received will be used to inform the development of requirements for a future acquisition for the rebuild of ED.gov. This challenge is not intended to lead to a follow-on acquisition but rather is a form of market research. Still, applicants are allowed to compete for the implementation contract following the prototype submission, even if their submission was not chosen for the redesign challenge. The two processes are independent of each other (see more details below).  \n \nED’s website is a content and information hub. Redesign innovators should focus on that foundation.  In the improved design, ED.gov should have: \n \n* Accessible content for desktop, mobile, and tablet users; \n* Integrated social media, RSS feeds, and subscription services; \n* Elegant, clean, simple, user-centered look and feel with a modern aesthetic; \n* Strong ED branding on the homepage, and throughout the entire site with a consistent appearance; \n* New and innovative tools that enhance user experience; and \n* Engaging and easy-to-navigate pages. \n \n*Performance Objectives* \n \nThe redesign of ED.gov should engage the American public, amplify the Secretary’s message, and advance ED’s policy goals, while maintaining high availability and high performance.  \n \nInnovators should ensure to the greatest extent practicable that any design supports the federally mandated [21st Century Idea Act](https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ336/PLAW-115publ336.pdf) for modernization, including complying with the following: \n \n* Be accessible to individuals with disabilities by applying section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. \n* Uses the [US Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) maturity model to create and implement the site. \n* Have a consistent appearance. \n* Contain a search function intended for public use. \n* Be provided through an industry-standard, secure connection. \n* Be fully functional and usable on common mobile devices. \n \n*Key Parameters* \n \nIn redesigning ED.gov, Challenge participants should focus on six (6) key templates: \n \n1. Homepage (<http://www.ed.gov>); \n2. Program office page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/om/fs_po/ocr/home.html?src=oc>) \n3. Informational page (<https://www2.ed.gov/fund/grants-college.html?src=pn>); \n4. Grant page (<https://www2.ed.gov/programs/fws/index.html>); \n5. Contact page (<https://www2.ed.gov/about/contacts/gen/index.html?src=ft>); and \n6. News page (<http://www.ed.gov/news>). \n \nThe prototype must also comply with the following directives: \n \n* New designs should conform with ED’s existing color scheme and use its current seal. \n* New designs must not use proprietary software or operating systems unless necessary. \n* The site should use either the Drupal and/or WordPress open-source CMS for web or content creation and for managing information or content on a webpage. \n \nPrototypes may incorporate text and content already available on the website, or dummy text. \n \n*Deliverables* \n \nTo meet the need of this challenge, participants should provide a link to an interactive prototype of an ED.gov redesign for the above six pages.  In addition, participants should provide back-up documentation for the prototype that includes: \n \n* Wireframes that present the site layout and navigation. \n* Mock-ups that include the layout and navigation from the wireframes but with brand and site colors, logo, images, content blocks, typography, etc. \n* Other information such as open-source CMS used, development language(s), browser(s) supported, mobile compatibility, screen resolutions (including responsive for mobile), operating systems, assistive technologies, text sizing, etc.",

            "description": "The Public Safety Communications Research Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology is conducting the Automated Streams Analysis for Public Safety (ASAPS) Prize Challenge, authorized under Section 105 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No 111-358), as codified in 15 U.S.C. § 3719. \n \nThis challenge anticipates awarding prizes to challenge contestants who submit innovative approaches that address information extraction across ASAPS multimodal data streams and perform fusion in real time across extracted data to generate actionable data reports about simulated and staged emergency events. One of the most important objectives of this program is to demonstrate how data can be used to enable decision support tools and capabilities for public safety. This challenge is a nationwide innovation contest taking place throughout 2020, 2021, and 2022. The challenge is anticipated to be administered in four discrete contests. In the context of multiple contests, these are the official rules for Contest 1 only. \n \nContest 1 will focus on developing innovative “plans of attack” focused on data extraction and fusion, refining and focusing the details relevant to the ASAPS Challenge’s problem statement, partnering between contestants to form highly qualified teams, and encouraging collaborative and creative thought around potential approaches to developing solutions. NIST anticipates awarding up to $150,000 in cash to winning contestants in Contest 1. In addition, contestants will be familiarized with the development data set and version 1.0 of the test harness and encouraged to provide feedback for potential updates in advance of the second contest. \n \n* Pre-registration begins: February 10, 2020 \n* Open to submissions: April 13, 2020 \n* Submission deadline: August 7, 2020 @ 5pm ET \n* Reviewing & Judging: August 10 to September 14, 2020 \n* Winners Announced: September 17, 2020 \n \nThe area of real-time automated analytics is understudied – especially with regards to the analytic fusion of multiple sources of unstructured information in real-time. The future of public safety demands automated solutions to analyze live data, provide improved situational awareness, and alert and inform decision making. \n \nExtracting information from video, audio and textual communications, social media, and sensors presents a significant analytic challenge. It is virtually impossible for humans to co-analyze these data streams in real-time, and, currently, there are few automated tools to analyze these types of unstructured data in real-time and virtually no automated tools to create dynamic analytic models of public safety emergencies as emergency situations evolve. \n \nWith the maturation of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, specialized architectures and processors for AI applications, cloud computing, high-speed communications networks and streaming data resources and protocols, it is now possible to create automated tools to assist public safety organizations in analyzing the increasingly large amounts of information at their fingertips to help them make the most informed decisions based on a comprehensive analysis of the data available. Such tools will help distill, structure, and present the quickly evolving information from a multitude of data streams to public safety organizations in a way that supports time-critical decision making and serves as an essential force multiplier. \n \nDue to the multitude of sensors and devices being used in public safety along with communications data collected in operations and contributed by the public, and the multi-modal nature of all of these data streams, transforming data, especially unstructured data, into information in real-time is one of the key technology gaps that must be bridged to achieve advances in this area. The available technology is insufficient to bridge this technological gap because: \n \n* Most automated data analysis tools have been developed for use with archival data and focus on post-event forensic analysis. \n* Few analytic technologies focus on a moving representation of live streaming data that is updated over time, and that can be used to show temporal changes in the analysis. \n* Tools that make data available to first responders in real-time are heavily weighted towards a visual representation of responder location and structured reporting of known emergency communications. \n* Few public safety emergency analysis tools exist that provide an effective real-time automated analysis and fusion of information from unstructured public safety communications streams and sensor- and citizen-generated data streams. \n \nNote that while public safety organizations must often grapple with answering the who, what, when, and where of emergencies, the research supported by this Challenge focuses only on the what, when, and where aspects of streaming data analysis and specifically excludes identity-related technologies such as facial and voice biometrics which are considered out of scope for this research program - with the exception of technology to maintain scene-relative identification of people/vehicle/object/place entities involved in emergencies in order to associate activities with the entities they are involved with. This focus of the Challenge is because the area of identifying the situational and time-critical evolving characteristics of an emergency across information streams is under-researched. This Challenge seeks to focus research on analyzing a plethora of fast-moving data streams for life/infrastructure-critical situational information to support both effective and efficient response. \n \nPublic safety organizations are inundated with live streaming data from a variety of sources. This live streaming data generally falls into two categories - some of this data is structured, while much of it is unstructured. Structured data that resides in a fixed field within a record or file (the kind typically found in spreadsheets or relational databases) is formatted in a way so that it can be readily queried. By contrast, unstructured data (e.g., video and audio) generally does not have a pre-*defined data* model or is not organized in a pre-*defined* manner and, therefore, is not readily searchable. The lack of a defined data model prevents the data from being automatically interpreted and used by automated decision support applications without significant human intervention. \n \nIn this first contest, NIST PSCR is inviting a novel multidisciplinary community to share its vision for how to analyze numerous live data streams, understand the data, and transform it into information to support public safety decisions. We are looking for ideas that address the following analytic tasks as well as an overall extraction to analysis systems platform approach to the contest elements. The core analytic tasks for this contest can be broadly described as: \n \n1. **Information extraction across data streams and data sources:** Structured information is continuously extracted from each of the data streams that are necessary to support downstream analysis and detection of emergency events. \n2. **Information fusion across extracted data and generation of live/dynamic information representation:** Joint inferencing is performed across all of the information in the extracted streams to create an event-level analysis of an emergency and store that information in a dynamically evolving structured data representation that can be utilized at any time during the life of an emergency. \n3. **Automated emergency event analysis:**Highly actionable analytic reports about emergency events are generated from the extracted/fused structured information (as described in the above topics) into a form that can be readily rendered into actionable user-readable reports in real-time and in both ongoing and summary forms. \n \nSuccess in this ideation contest is dependent upon a clear vision of the components, platform, and novel approaches that fulfill the functions of real-time information extraction, live dynamic information fusion and representation, and evolving emergency event analysis. \n \nFigure 1. A rendering of the flow of streaming data through a conceptual ASAPS system. **Contest 1 focuses ONLY on the extraction and core analysis components of the system**. Later contests will expand the focus to include the end user interfaces to the analytic information. \n \n![ASAPS system rending](/assets/netlify-uploads/asaps-rendering.jpg \"Rendering of the flow of streaming data through a conceptual ASAPS system\") \n \nThis figure is a simplified depiction of the flow of information through an analytic process and not prescriptive of the approaches that might be developed to address the challenge. \n \nTo provide some additional clarity on the context and make-up of the data, <a href=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/netlify-uploads/asaps-tables-data-events.pdf\">see tables for examples of public safety data types and emergency events</a>. \n \nAdditional information on the Challenge can be found on *[www.herox.com/ASAPS1](http://www.herox.com/ASAPS1)*.

Registration provides both a legal framework that includes safeguards and client protections, as well as mechanisms for recourse in the event an issue arises. \n \nThe goal of the RED List is to provide information to U.S. customers about foreign entities that are acting in an unregistered capacity and to help them make more informed decisions about whether to trade with or through such an entity. While registration is no guarantee against fraud or mismanagement by an otherwise unscrupulous firm or individual, registration does bring a higher level of security and accountability to the trading public. Customers that trade with and through registered entities have greater protections and recourse available. \n \nIn certain cases, a review by the CFTC reveals that certain foreign entities solicit and/or accept funds from U.S. customers, have limited or no U.S. presence, and may be acting in a capacity that requires registration, but yet are *not* registered with the CFTC. After such review, foreign entities which meet the RED List criteria are included on the RED List. \n \nThe process to update and maintain the RED List relies on tips and referrals from concerned individuals as well as investigative work by CFTC staff. The work is time-intensive. Given the scope of global markets, range of participants, and limited resources, the process could benefit from technology applications, including those that leverage AI, which can identify and flag potentially problematic activity for further follow-up by CFTC staff. This may enable a more efficient and comprehensive search and review process to identify foreign entities for inclusion on the RED List. Also, it could enable the CFTC to be proactive in its ongoing efforts to maintain the RED List. Currently, it is only after wrongdoing is *reported* that an entity is investigated for possible enforcement action or inclusion on the RED List. \n \n#### Competition \n \nThe goal of Project Streetlamp is to explore how AI and other technologies can help the CFTC maintain a comprehensive, up-to-date RED List by automating the process of identifying foreign entities potentially engaged in CFTC-regulated activity.  AI could be an important component of such a tool, because the technology has the potential to learn the “footprints” of actors that are unregistered, but engaged in CFTC-regulated activity. For example, key identifying data (*e.g.*, keywords, website data, audience information, network and outreach, etc.) associated with unregistered entities known to be engaged in CFTC-regulated activity could be used to develop a model that is useful for identifying other unknown entities. \n \nParticipants will develop a tool to identify companies engaged in activity that the CFTC should investigate further for possible inclusion on the RED List. Such activity may include, but is not limited to: soliciting or accepting customers’ orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool. This information may also help identify broader trends or behavior that the CFTC finds helpful to target customer education and awareness efforts. \n \n#### RED List Inclusion Criteria \n \nThe following criteria may help competition participants develop a tool that can appropriately identify foreign entities that should be included on the CFTC’s RED List. \n \n*1.  Is the entity foreign?* \n \nOnly foreign entities are included on the RED List. For purposes of the tool, an entity is foreign if its place of business is anywhere other than the U.S. An entity may not be domestic simply because it self-identifies as having a physical presence in the U.S. \n \n*2.  Does the foreign entity have any or a limited U.S. presence?* \n \nFor purposes of the tool, an entity that has only a limited U.S. presence may still be considered a “foreign entity” and included on the RED List. An entity will be considered to have a limited U.S. presence if its only presence is: a virtual office; a sham address; a U.S. phone number; or its website or domain hosting service. An entity that has more than a limited U.S. presence is not considered a “foreign entity,” and therefore the tool should not designate it for the RED List. For this purpose, indicia of a U.S. presence may include, among other things, whether an entity has: a U.S. agent or representative; a bank or other financial account(s) held by a financial institution in the U.S; a physical office space; or any other substantive presence in the U.S. \n \n*3.  Does the foreign entity appear to solicit or accept U.S.-based residents?* \n \nFor purposes of the tool, an entity solicits a U.S. resident if, from a U.S.-based IP address: a U.S. resident is able to open an account with the entity; or the entity does not block a U.S. resident from opening an account. \n \n*4.  Does the foreign entity offer products within the CFTC’s jurisdiction, including for example, futures, options on futures (“options”), foreign currency (“forex”), binary options, leveraged metals, contracts for difference (“CFD”), or Bitcoin derivatives (and any other virtual currency contracts regulated by the CFTC)?* \n \nWhere an unregistered foreign entity offers futures, options, forex, CFDs, or other derivatives subject to CFTC jurisdiction to U.S. customers the tool should consider this a positive factor for inclusion on the RED List. \n \n*5.  Is the foreign entity required to be registered with the CFTC?* \n \nFor purposes of the tool, conduct in connection with a CFTC jurisdictional product that requires registration with the CFTC may include, among other things: accepting customer funds; soliciting or accepting customers’ orders; soliciting discretionary accounts; directing customer accounts; providing commodity trading advice; or operating a commodity pool. \n \n*6.  Is the foreign entity currently not registered with the CFTC?* \n \nThe National Futures Association’s public registration database at <https://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet> includes entities that are registered with the CFTC. If an entity is registered or has an exemption from registration, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List. \n \n*7.  In the case of binary options, is the foreign entity currently not registered as a Foreign Board of Trade (“FBOT”)?* \n \nThe CFTC maintains a [database of registered FBOT’s](https://sirt.cftc.gov/sirt/sirt.aspx?Topic=ForeignBoardsofTrade). If an entity is registered as an FBOT, the tool should not designate it for inclusion on the RED List. \n \n#### Outputs \n \nFor purposes of this contest, successful tools will use AI and/or other technology to scan public sources and relevant data. To accomplish this, a tool should be able to assess foreign entities against the criteria listed above in order to generate a report that identifies foreign entities for potential inclusion on the RED List. To the extent possible, the output should include the foreign entity’s name and/or “doing business as” name, country of origin, owners/operators, and contact information (phone, email, social media, website(s), and/or address(es)), as may be available. The tool should also be able to provide a justification based on the criteria above for why any particular foreign entity has been identified. \n \nFinally, the tool should incorporate an archive function that saves searches and results for future reference and audit purposes. \n \nParticipants will determine the best approach to create their tool and to deploy it, as well as the format of the report and output that is generated. The output may be in any machine readable format (*e.g.*, csv, xml, excel) to facilitate further analysis. \n \n*Note: Reference to the NFA is for informational purposes only and does not constitute endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the U.S. government.*",

            "description": "#### Summary \n \nAn estimated [25.5 million Americans experience a travel-limiting disability](https://www.bts.gov/travel-patterns-with-disabilities) that impacts their access to employment, medical care, and other activities of daily living. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the critical need for vulnerable populations to have on-demand transportation services to access healthcare, pharmacies, grocery stores, and other essential services. Automated vehicles, particularly those designed to be operated exclusively by Level 4 and Level 5 Automated Driving Systems (ADS), hold great promise to enhance freedom of movement for these individuals. However, fulfilling this promise will require innovation and creativity, not only in how vehicles drive themselves, but also in how all users access and interact with them. \n \nThrough the Inclusive Design Challenge, the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) seeks innovative, inclusive design features to enable people with physical, sensory, and cognitive disabilities to use automated vehicles, particularly ADS-dedicated vehicles (ADS-DV) that are operated exclusively at Levels 4 and 5 (see Notes on Terminology below for additional detail on terms used throughout this Challenge). Solutions must address one or more aspects of ADS-DV use - such as locating and entering an ADS-DV or interacting with the vehicle in routine and emergency situations - through physical hardware and/or human-machine interface (HMI) designs. Individuals and teams will compete for an overall prize purse of up to $5,000,000 in a two-stage competition. In Stage I, DOT solicits brief technical proposals for inclusive design features that could then be demonstrated in prototype form by semifinalists in Stage II. \n \nBy using a prize competition format, DOT seeks to draw attention to the topic of passenger vehicle accessibility; encourage new cross-disciplinary collaborations; incentivize the development of new approaches and technologies to improve mobility; and tap into the creativity and knowledge of the disability community, researchers, advocates, manufacturers, and entrepreneurs. DOT aims to attract ideas from around the nation to identify new solutions for common access issues. \n \nThis Challenge seeks inclusive solutions, referring to features and designs that enable access to and use of a vehicle by people with a wide range of physical, sensory and cognitive disabilities. Technology has already changed how most of us get around. This Challenge seeks to ensure that these new technology-driven mobility options are inclusive of all Americans. \n \n#### Background \n \nDOT is eager to realize the potential mobility benefits that ADS-DVs could bring to people with disabilities. ADS-DVs, could offer greater levels of mobility for individuals who either cannot drive or require a vehicle with extensive modifications, but only if their needs are considered explicitly and incorporated into future ADS-DV designs. DOT recognizes that the diversity of disabilities and resulting implications for vehicle design features makes this a complicated engineering challenge. While some mobility services (e.g., public transportation or for-hire vehicles, such as taxis) currently incorporate some accessibility features, few of these features are universally included in passenger vehicles as part of vehicle design. Meanwhile, aftermarket solutions tend to be expensive and cumbersome. \n \nSeveral recent publications are provided at [www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign](https://www.transportation.gov/accessibility/inclusivedesign) to offer further information on the needs, challenges, and opportunities that ADS-DVs introduce for people with disabilities. \n \n#### Challenge Details \n \nDOT seeks ideas for inclusive features that will enable future ADS-DVs to meet the needs of people with disabilities safely, effectively, and efficiently. Participants will compete for cash prizes by developing innovative design solutions to increase access to and use of ADS-DVs for people with disabilities. Such features can be human-machine interfaces, physical hardware designs, or combinations thereof that can allow a person with a physical, sensory, and/or cognitive disability to perform one or more tasks required to use an ADS-DV. Solutions may be proposed as standalone features or integrated into a holistic vehicle design. Successful solutions will show that they have taken into account production feasibility and an understanding of the needs and constraints of both industry and travelers with disabilities. The Department notes that it is seeking to further innovation in inclusive design for ADS-DVs with this Challenge, rather than the development of the Automated Driving Systems themselves. Thus, awards are judged solely on the factors described in this statement, and are not based on the sophistication Of any ADS included as part of a prototype vehicle. See Stage II Prototype/Demonstration below for additional details on prototype expectations and requirements. \n \nThe sections below provide important information on elements to consider as part of your Challenge solution. \n \n##### *Vehicle Platform* \n \nParticipants should consider features intended to be incorporated into vehicles that can serve a wide range of communities and are capable of operating at highway speeds. Participants have flexibility in choosing a vehicle to use as a reference or base platform in developing their feature(s), keeping in mind the focus of the Challenge is developing inclusive solutions for ADS-DVs that could either function as personal vehicles or as part of a shared private fleet. Please note that the Challenge is not specifically soliciting solutions to be used exclusively in public transportation. However, successful solutions may have application to both private and public transportation. \n \n##### *Vehicle Use* \n \nParticipants will develop inclusive design solutions to address one or more of the following tasks that an ADS-DV user with a disability will need to complete: \n \n* Locating an ADS-DV - Including, but not limited to, being notified that a vehicle has arrived; identifying the correct vehicle and locating and navigating to the correct vehicle. \n* Entering an ADS-DV- Including, but not limited to, unlocking and opening vehicle door(s); deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for wheelchair users or people with other physical disabilities or mobility equipment; and closing vehicle door(s). \n* Securing Passengers and Mobility Equipment - Including, but not limited to, securing seatbelts and other passenger restraints; securing wheelchairs or other mobility equipment to the vehicle; and accommodating service animals. \n* Inputting Information - Including, but not limited to, confirming passenger identity; searching for, entering, and changing a desired destination; confirming the vehicle's destination; selecting a specific drop-off point (e.g., a particular entrance to a large complex or a location with a curb cut or sufficient space to deploy a ramp or other physical device). \n* Interacting with the ADS in routine and emergency situations - Including, but not limited to, operating passenger convenience and safety features (e.g., entertainment, window controls, locks, climate control); monitoring the vehicle's location and route progress; changing the vehicle's destination en route; requesting assistance (emergency or non-emergency); understanding and performing appropriate actions in the event of a breakdown or crash. \n* Exiting an ADS-DV - Including, but not limited to, being notified and confirming that a vehicle has reached its intended destination; releasing passenger and/or mobility equipment restraints; identifying and locating the safe and appropriate door(s) from which to exit the vehicle; recognizing when it is safe to exit a vehicle; opening door(s) and deploying and stowing ramps or other equipment enabling access for passengers and/or mobility equipment (e.g., wheelchairs). \n \n##### *Disability Types* \n \nFor the Challenge, inclusiveness will be evaluated, in part, by the extent to which proposed solutions address a range of disabilities and needs. As noted above, applicants will need to demonstrate working engagement(s) with representatives from the disability community in their design process. \n \nParticipants will also focus their efforts by designing solutions for use by one or more of the following groups: \n \n* People with physical disabilities \n* People with sensory disabilities \n* People with cognitive disabilities \n* People with multiple types of disabilities \n \n##### *Production Feasibility* \n \nDOT seeks proposals through this Challenge that strike a balance between innovation and near-term implementation. For innovation to have the desired impact, implementation is critical. Participants are expected to discuss factors related to the feasibility of producing their solution(s), including the maturity of the technology underlying the inclusive design elements of the proposed design, as well as cost and other production considerations. \"Production\" here refers to the incorporation of the proposed solution(s) into a vehicle as original equipment, integration into an existing vehicle platform as part of an aftermarket modification, or a holistic reimagining of passenger vehicle design with a focus on seamlessly integrating inclusive features. \n \n#### Challenge Structure \n \n##### *Overall Schedule* \n \nDOT anticipates that the Challenge will proceed according to the schedule outlined below. Dates are subject to change with any changes being posted on the DOT's Challenge website accordingly. \n \n* Stage I Launch: April 21, 2020 \n* Stage I Close: October 30, 2020, 5:00 PM Eastern \n* Stage I Selection/ Awards, Launch of Stage II: January 2021 (anticipated) \n* Stage II Design Charrette: Summer 2021 (anticipated) \n* Stage II Close, Prototype Demonstrations at U.S. DOT Headquarters: June 2022 (anticipated) \n* Stage II Prize Selections: July 2022 (anticipated) \n \n##### *Stage I, Proof of Concept* \n \nIn Stage I, eligible Participants will submit proposals for inclusive design solutions for ADS-DVs. DOT will select up to ten semifinalists to advance to Stage II to develop a functional prototype of their idea and compete for a cash prize. \n \nStage I proposals will be limited to written, descriptive summaries (no more than 10 pages; see \"Stage I Submission Requirements\" below for additional detail on proposal length constraints), supporting visual exhibits, and accompanying information (team biographies, etc.) as outlined below. \n \n##### *Stage II, Prototype/Demonstration* \n \nIn Stage II, the semifinalists selected to advance from Stage I will develop their concepts into functional prototypes of an inclusive design solution. \n \nA functional prototype may include one or more of the options outlined below, as appropriate given the nature of solution(s) being demonstrated, their sophistication, and the time available. DOT will not require semifinalists to demonstrate their proposed feature(s) on an actual vehicle, although a team may determine that doing so is necessary and/or advantageous to illustrate maturity, production/integration feasibility, or functionality. \n \n* **Full-size physical prototype**, either: \n \n  * Integrated into a vehicle (the vehicle itself does not need to be automated, but should be reflective of vehicles being developed and tested with Level 4 or 5 automation). \n  * Full-size, standalone demonstration separate from a vehicle. In this case, Participants should be prepared to illustrate how their proposed solution would be integrated into a full-size vehicle, potentially through one of the other prototype approaches listed. \n* **Software prototype** - Given that certain solutions or components of broader solutions will entail a software/interface component, Participants can consider functioning software interfaces as prototypes. \n* **Scale physical prototype** - If a full-size physical prototype is infeasible for the proposed solution given the time and resources available, Participants may consider demonstrating their concept via a scale model. Accompanying demonstration exhibits may complement scale prototypes, particularly to demonstrate engineering feasibility, integration into a vehicle platform, and usability. \n* **Virtual prototype** - DOT will consider the submission of virtual prototypes (3D models, computer-aided design (CAD) drawings, schematics) of physical solutions, but strongly encourages Participants to consider other primary means of demonstrating their solution(s), and to limit the use of virtual prototypes to supporting/secondary exhibits. \n \nDOT anticipates that partway through Stage II one or more design charrettes will be held with subject matter experts from industry and the disability community. At the end of Stage II, teams will be invited to Washington, D.C. to demonstrate their prototypes. After this, the final prize selections will be announced. Up to three finalists will be selected and awarded a portion of the remaining prize purse, contingent upon review of the Stage II submissions and demonstrations against the judging criteria. As discussed below under Judging Criteria, the details of Stage II are subject to change and will not be finalized until Stage I is complete. DOT may, in its sole discretion, not proceed with Stage II.",
            "prizes": "The Challenge consists of two stages. Individuals and teams will compete for an overall prize purse of up to $5,000,000. The prize purse is part of the $100 million allocated in Fiscal Year 2018 for a \"Highly automated vehicle research and development program\" through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-141) and its accompanying Explanatory Statement. \n \nIn Stage I, DOT will select up to ten semifinalists to advance to Stage II; each will receive $300,000 in prize money, which may be used to support the development of their prototype in Stage II. If a selectee declines to participate in the next stage, an alternate semifinalist may be selected. In Stage II, DOT will select three winning teams to receive a portion of the remaining prize purse. \n \nPrizes will be structured as follows: \n \n* Stage I Proof-of-Concept: Total prize funds awarded = Up to $3,000,000 \n \n  * Up to 10 Semifinalists will be selected \n  * Each will receive $300,000 upon selection as a Semifinalist \n* Stage II Prototype/Demonstration: Total prize funds awarded = $2,000,000 \n \n  * Winner (1st place) will receive $1,000,000 \n  * 2nd place receives $700,000 \n  * 3rd place receives $300,000",

More specifically, such authority includes the right to copy, distribute, publicly display and publicly perform all parts of Participant's submission. \n \n#### Notes on Terminology \n \n1. This Challenge focuses specifically on vehicles operated exclusively by a Level 4 and 5 ADS, a level of automation at which human occupants are not expected to serve as a fallback, as long as the vehicle remains within the system's operational design domain. In its standard J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems, SAE International refers to such vehicles as ADS-dedicated vehicles or ADS-DVs. DOT recognizes that some solutions proposed through this Challenge may also be applicable to dual-mode vehicles - capable of both driverless operation and operation by a conventional driver for a complete trip. \n2. In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-14]), Congress reallocated $100 million for \". . . a highly automated vehicle (HAV) research and development program,\" a portion of which is being used to fund this Challenge. The accompanying Explanatory Statement further clarified: \"Of the total amount provided, not less than $38,000,000 shall be used for direct research, including administrative expenses, on HAV and \\[Advanced Driver Assistance System] technologies by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the Federal Transit Administration, of which no more than $5,000,000 shall be for ADAS research. For the purposes of the agreement, HAV refers to technologies capable of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) DOT Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automation, whereas ADAS refers to technologies capable of Level 1 or Level 2\" (Division L, Title 1). DOT previously used the term HAV to refer to vehicles with Level 3-5 driving automation, but subsequently adopted the terminology in SAE J3016 Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems.",
            "judging": " \n \n#### Stage I Judging Criteria \n \nThe judging panel will consider each submission's alignment with each of these criteria and make recommendations to the Secretary of Transportation.

            "description": "Though the proportions of women and men are similar at the graduate level for biomedical sciences and in medical schools, women are underrepresented at the faculty level in both science and medicine, particularly in the mid- to senior-level ranks ([National Science Foundation 2017 Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19301/); and [2016 CBE Life Sci Educ. 15(3)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27587850/)). Diversity of thought and expertise have been recognized as attributes that drive innovation, complement dynamic research, and promote excellence. Supporting the sustained advancement of women in biomedical careers has the potential to enhance such diversity in the faculty ranks across scientific fields. Doing so will also promote more inclusive research and clinical environments which are critical to retaining and advancing women in biomedical careers. \n \nUnderstanding that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to enhancing diversity in academia and that ideas based on evidence are necessary to achieve systemic change, this prize competition will recognize institutions for approaches that have clearly succeeded in addressing faculty diversity and equity issues in biomedical and behavioral science departments, centers, or divisions. The aim is to acknowledge and recognize transformative structures, systems, projects, programs, and processes that were implemented to successfully enhance and sustain gender diversity within the institution. For example, success could have been accomplished through addressing barriers to career advancement, employing mentoring structures, adopting work-life integration and career flexibility programs, enhancing pathways to leadership, implementing specific recruitment efforts, changing workplace culture, or other approaches. This prize competition may build on the outcomes of previous initiatives, such as NIH’s Research on Causal Factors and Interventions that Promote and Support the Careers of Women in Biomedical and Behavioral Science and Engineering ([RFA-FM-09-012](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/rfa-gm-09-012.html)), the National Science Foundation [ADVANCE](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5383) program, or other programs and/or internal initiatives in support of interventions that improve the climate and career advancement for women faculty at academic institutions. \n \nCritical to this prize competition is the identification of best practices, the sharing of lessons learned, and the delineation of evidence-based approaches that can be broadly translated to, and replicated by, other institutions. These approaches may represent policies, evidence-based programs, tools, and/or activities, or a mixture thereof. Because this prize competition recognizes achievement through past intervention(s), such interventions must have been implemented prior to the launch date of this prize competition. The interventions must also have a demonstrated record as an effective model that can be adapted by other institutions and organizations. The past efforts and interventions should have addressed the full range of faculty career stages, from junior faculty to senior leadership, as well as potential sources of gender-based inequities, such as pay or allocation of resources. Applicants will need to demonstrate how their interventions have directly led to sustained systemic changes within the institution. Therefore, an in-depth assessment of institutional composition, policies, other relevant factors that were potential barriers to gender diversity and equity, and were subsequently mitigated through intervention(s), will need to be included in the submission. Submissions most likely to win the prize competition will have developed tools and/or interventions that can be employed to assist other institutions or academic groups with issues of inclusion and help to create environments that facilitate achievement. These efforts should be amenable to wide dissemination and implementation, as best practices for enhancing faculty gender diversity in biomedical and behavioral sciences.",

            "judging": "<div class=\"judging-criterias\"> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 1. Impact and Innovation (20 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">20%</strong> </h4> <p>Solutions will be evaluated for creativity and originality of designs. An innovative approach may be novel, groundbreaking, or paradigm-shifting, or a creative application of existing approaches. For Phase 1 submissions, the approach should also be feasible; i.e., have a high likelihood to succeed in meeting or exceeding the scientific evaluation criteria NEI has defined. Overall, the solution should provide a novel solution to building a 3-D human retina that meets the desired scientific criteria (structure, function, morphology). Reviewers will be asked to specifically&nbsp;address:</p> <ul type=\"disc\"> <li>Impact on potential end users, clinical implications, and therapeutic advances &mdash;To what extent will the solution exert a sustained, powerful influence on the understanding of retinal diseases and accelerating research toward new&nbsp;therapies?</li> <li>To what extent does the solution address a significant barrier in the development of human retina organoids that are highly representative of human physiology? Does the approach speed up organoid development and differentiation time, improve yield, or increase&nbsp;production?</li> <li>How is the solution unique and does it improve upon state of the science for organoid&nbsp;technology?</li> <li>To what extent are novel concepts, approaches, methodologies, technologies or instrumentation used, or are existing approaches applied in a novel&nbsp;way?</li> </ul> </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 2. Cell Types, Structure, and Function (25 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">25%</strong> </h4> Solutions will be evaluated for establishment of a human PSC-derived in vitro retina model system that resembles the morphology of a healthy-native retina and is viable through formation of photoreceptor outer segments and/or long-term survival of retinal ganglion cells with extension of axonal processes. Reviewers will be asked to address:&nbsp;Cell Types:&nbsp;How many neuronal (or neuronal derived) cell types are stably co-cultured (rod and cone photoreceptors, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells, Muller glia)? Are long-term viable and functional RPE, choroid or non-neuronal cell types (e.g., pericytes, microglia, astrocytes) incorporated? To what extent does the evidence presented show presence of cell types and 3-dimensional structure. If a cell type is lacking, is there justification for why it is not present and not needed for proof of principle (i.e. the disease being modelled lacks the specific cell type)?  Structure:&nbsp;Are organoid prototypes 3-dimensional and properly oriented? To what extent do the synaptic layers recapitulate those of a laminated retina with multiple neuron classes present in numbers and proportions that represent an in vivo setting (as indicated by biomarkers of lineage and differentiation)? How many other retina and retina-relevant tissues, cells, or structures are included?  Functional characterization of cell types:&nbsp;Are all cell types in the organoid (or added to the organoid) functional through the latest viable timepoint as shown by appropriate analyses, including electrophysiology (e.g., light response and recovery for subsequent responses, etc.), retinoid recycling, cell communication, functional connectivity, fluid transport in RPE, etc.? </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 3. Reproducibility, Quality Control, and Standardization (25 points) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">25%</strong> </h4> Assessment of inter/intra-laboratory utility, transferability, and reproducibility, with conclusive evidence that organoid prototype is based on a reproducible protocol and the protocol produces a relatively standardized product. Reproducibility:&nbsp;To what extent do the data support reproducibility and standardization (e.g., data showing transferability to other labs and lack of variability from batch to batch) included?  To what extent is documentation of standardization or commercialization highlighted (i.e. cGMP protocols or patent applications)? Are the methods (part of the Appendix) sufficiently detailed such that the efforts could be reproduced (e.g., Standard operating protocols)?  Robustness:&nbsp;How do the data support advances in organoid development to decrease differentiation time, improve yield, or increase production?  Have retina organoids been characterized to show they are free of microbial contamination and chromosomal defects (i.e. karyotyping, STR analysis, FISH analysis)?  Are formal documented agreements with industry, or transferability to industry partners (MOUs, licensing, CRADA, in-kind or discounted validation) presented? </div> <div class=\"prize-item\"> <h4>Evaluation Criterion 4. Endpoint Assay Specific Goals (30 points for EITHER category) - <strong class=\"text-primary\">30%</strong> </h4> BIOLOGY/DISEASE MODELING (note:&nbsp;NEI is agnostic to which disease is chosen, as long as technology is developed to robustly recapitulate the disease):&nbsp;Does the organoid prototype demonstrate improvement in faithful biological complexity (e.g. macula, multiple cell subtypes present in physiologically similar ratios, etc.)?  Does the model recapitulate some aspect of disease phenotype in one or more assays?  Viability and scalability:&nbsp;If grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of organoids in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained? Are methods that increase the production (e.g., many dozens) of organoids and/or allow the distribution of well-characterized organoids presented to enable multiple organoids to be compared in the same experiment?  Is therapeutic intervention to treat the disease modelled with 3-D retina organoids (e.g. via gene editing, small molecules, cell replacement, etc.) demonstrated? HIGH CONTENT SCREENING:&nbsp;Are retina organoid prototypes amenable to high content screening, which may include high content imaging, drug validation/toxicology, or functional genomic screening (e.g. does not include materials known to show strong compound adsorption)? Does the model recapitulate known retina toxicities based on morphological and functional readouts? Scalability and portability:&nbsp;Are organoids grown at medium throughput (e.g., in a 96-well plate) robust? When grown at one organoid/well, are 90% of wells in a plate viable, as shown by random sampling in five wells across a dish? For how long are morphological and functional features maintained? Are methods to mass-produce (e.g., 100s) organoids such that multiple plates can be compared in the same experiment included? </div> </div>",
