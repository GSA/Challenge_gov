## To Contribute to fixing bugs, developing features and enhancements

Before submitting a contribution, you’ll just need to create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing account.  

Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
Create a branch from `production` and name it in a way that lightly defines what you’re working on (for example, `add-styles`).
Once you’re ready to submit a pull request, fill out the [pull request template (https://github.com/GSA/Challenge_gov/compare)
Submit your pull request against the `main` branch. 

If the pull request is accepted, we will merge the pull request for you. 

## How we prioritize

Once you’ve submitted a contribution, we'll review the code and triage it based on the following considerations:
1. **Severity:** What type of functionality is impacted? Is there a workaround?
2. **Priority:** Does this align with our vision and roadmap goals?
3. **Size:** Can we accomplish this in a 2 week sprint or will this take longer? 

Note: We prioritize issues that affect accessibility, user experience, and system security. 

These considerations help us decide if and when we can work on the issue. If the issue is accepted, we will schedule them for an upcoming 2-week sprint.
